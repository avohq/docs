> ðŸ’¡ **Avo Codegen** produces type-safe wrappers around your analytics event tracking calls,
> to make it easier and faster to implement your analytics tracking calls. <Link passHref href="/implementation/devs-101"><a>Read more about Avo Codegen here.</a></Link>

Avo Codegen is generated based on the events in your tracking plan, so when
an event is updated in your tracking plan, you generate the code again to get the
updated implementation requirements applied to your type safe analytics code.

### [Recommended] Set up Avo CLI to connect Avo Codegen to your repo

We recommend connecting your repository to a Source in your Avo Tracking Plan, because
then all you need to do to update the generated code is run `avo pull [--branch my-branch] [SourceName]` from your
terminal, and that will update the generated code.

### Download Avo Codegen manually

If you want to skip setting up the CLI for some reason, you can Download or Copy
Avo Codegen manually:

1. Navigate to Codegen tab in the sidebar
2. Select your source
3. Go to "Avo Codegen Setup"
4. Scroll to the bottom and press "Click to generate your Avo file"

<center style={{ marginBottom: 16 + 'px' }}>
  <img
    src={require('../../images/generate-avo-file-manually.png')}
    alt="Implementation - Click to generate your Avo file"
  />
</center>

Your file will be generated after that and you'll be able to download or copy it from there.
