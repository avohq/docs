### <a name="missing-usual-property-in-event"></a>Property sometimes missing

There are two cases of this issue type:
- When a property is required in the tracking plan but sometimes or always missing
- Property not found in tracking plan but sometimes missing

_**Example:** Property onboarding status is not sent with 30% of the App Opened event._

### <a name="event-property-type-inconsistency"></a>Property type mismatch

Detects type changes of event properties across tracking calls.

There are two cases of this issue type:
- More than one property value type seen
- Property value type different from tracking plan

_**Example:** Inconsistent type of property onboarding status on event App Opened: int (84%), string (16%)._

### <a name="unextpected-event"></a>Unexpected event

Alert when an event that is not defined in the tracking plan is detected by Inspector

_**Example:** Event Signup Completedd not found in Tracking Plan._

### <a name="unextpected-property"></a>Unexpected property

Alert when an property that is not defined in the tracking plan is detected by Inspector

_**Example:** Property authenticationMethod not found in Tracking Plan._

### <a name="event-is-not-present-on-some-platforms"></a>Event missing on some platforms (coming soon)

Detects events sent by one platform, but not sent by another. Can be a sign of missing tracking calls.

_**Example:** iOS sends App Opened event, but Android does not._

### <a name="property-missing-on-some-platforms"></a>Property missing on some platforms (coming soon)

Detects properties sent by one platform, but not sent by another.

_**Example:** iOS sends user id with the App Opened event, but Android does not._

### <a name="event-volume-change-between-versions"></a>Event volume change significant between versions (coming soon)

Detects significant changes in event volume between app versions.

_**Example:** Volume of event App Opened drop by 25% between versions v1.3.2 and v1.3.3 on iOS_

### <a name="significant-volume-mismatch-between-platforms"></a>Event volume significantly different between platforms (coming soon)

Detects events sent way more frequently by one platform versus another adjusted for sessions number. Can be a sign of duplicated or missing tracking calls.

_**Example:** iOS is sending 10x more volume per session than Android of the App Opened event._

### <a name="event-name-casing"></a>Event name casing (coming soon)

Detects event names spelled in undesirable casing.

_**Example:** Event open_app is snake case, expected title case (Open App)._

### <a name="property-name-casing"></a>Property name casing (coming soon)

Detects property names spelled in undesirable casing.

_**Example:** The property onboarding_status on event App Opened is snake_case, expected camel case (onboardingStatus)._

### <a name="global-property-type-inconsistency"></a>Global property type mismatch (coming soon)

Detects properties with identical names and different types across all registered event schemas.

_**Example:** Inconsistent type of property revenue on events Purchase Completed: int and Checkout Completed: string._

  </a>

### <a name="similar-event-names"></a>Similar event names

Detects similar event names, that can point to duplicate tracking.

_**Example:** Potentially multiple events describing the same user action: App Opened, App Open, open_app + 2 more events._

### <a name="event-similar-property-names"></a>Similar property names within event

Detects similar property names in a single event.

_**Example:** Potentially multiple versions of the same property: onboarding_status, onboardingStatus, and Onboarding State._

### <a name="property-expected-type-mismatch"></a>Unexpected type based on property name

Detects when a property name that is often associated with a specific type has some other type.

_**Example:** Revenue property is string type (expected to be a number)._

### <a name="global-similar-property-names"></a>Global similar property names (low)

Detects similar property names across all registered event schemas.

_**Example:** Potentially multiple versions of the same property: onboarding_status, onboardingStatus, and Onboarding State._

### <a name="missing-usual-property-in-similar-events"></a>Missing property based on property group pattern

Detects missing property in a group of similarly looking properties.

_**Example:** Property onboarding_status is sent with 4 out of 5 events of the Onboarding events group._
