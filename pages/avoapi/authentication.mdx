Avo API uses `Basic authentication` to authenticate requests with avo service accounts.

## Authenticating with Avo API

Avo API accepts service account token as an authentication method.

Authenticate with the API:

### Step 1. Create Service Account

Start by <Link passHref href="/avoapi/authentication#creating-service-accounts"><a>Creating a Service Account</a></Link> and store the secret somewhere secure.

### Step 2. Authorization Header

The Avo API expects the authorization header to be set with BASIC auth.

- Base64 encoded `name:secret` from the service account.

```json
("authorization": "Basic <token>")
```

### Step 3. Send a Request with the header.

```sh
curl -H "authorization: Basic <token>" -X GET https://api.avo.app/workspaces/<WorkspaceId>/branches/<BranchId>/export/v1
```

## Creating Service Accounts

1. Open the settings cogwheel in the Avo sidebar, and open `Service Accounts`

   > It requires Avo Admin privileges to see this option in the cogwheel

2. Press `Create` in the service account list header, and give the service account a descriptive name and press `Create Service Account`.

   > Avo prefixes the name with `sa_pa_[randomId]_` so make sure to copy the final name

3. Copy the secret key and save it securely in your internal systems.
   > You will never see the secret key again, so make sure to copy it.

## Deleting a Service Account

If for some reason you need to delete your service account, you can do so from the service account management page.

1. Open the settings cogwheel in the Avo sidebar, and open `Service Accounts`

   > It requires Avo Admin privileges to see this option in the cogwheel

2. Click `Delete` button on the service account that you want to delete.

3. Press `Delete` again in the confirm window that pops up.

   > This action can not be undone. Once deleted, there is no way to recover the service account again.
