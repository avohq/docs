## <a name="workflow"></a> Workflow

We recommend checking the generated code from Avo as well as avo.json into git. Git workflows vary between teams, but below is a workflow between Avo and git that we recommend for most teams. Check out our <Link to="/commands#using-branches">CLI documentation</Link> to learn more about the branch commands.

When changes are made to a tracking plan in Avo:

1. Open a branch in Avo and make your changes
2. Share the Avo branch with a developer
3. Implement the changes in the Avo branch on a git branch. _We recommend having one git branch per source for each Avo branch_
4. Merge the git branch
5. Merge the Avo branch

Note: At this point avo.json on your git master is pointing to an Avo branch that has already been merged, which is perfectly fine! The Avo CLI will take care of automatically updating avo.json on next `avo pull`.

## <a name="resolving-conflicts"></a> Resolving Conflicts

As teams grow and more people are working on analytics implementation with Avo, chances are that conflicts in avo.json occur. The CLI is will help you resolve this conflicts, see more in the <Link to="/commands#git-conflicts">CLI documentation</Link>
