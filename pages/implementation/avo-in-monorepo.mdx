Avo supports monorepos out of the box. A single `avo.json` file in the root directory keeps track of all configured Avo sources for the repo, where the code for each source is located and when it was last updated.

To use Avo in a monorepo, initialize the Avo CLI by running `avo init` in the root of your repository. This will create a single `avo.json` file in the root of your monorepo. When you run `avo pull [--branch my-branch] [SourceName]` you pass in for which source you want to pull code for (e.g. `avo pull Web`). When you run `avo pull` for a new source for the first time, the CLI will prompt you to pick a location for the generated code (Avo Functions file) for that source. The `avo.json` file in the root keeps track of which sources are configured in the repo, where the Avo Functions file for each one lives, when the tracking for that source was last updated, and what Avo branch that update was based on.

Here's an example of how an `avo.json` could look like in a monorepo containing a web app, microservice, iOS app, Android app and docs page: 

```json
{
  "avo": {
    "version": 1
  },
  "schema": {
    "id": "<WORKSPACE_ID>",
    "name": "My Tracking Plan"
  },
  "branch": {
    "id": "main",
    "name": "main"
  },
  "sources": [
    {
      "id": "SOURCE_ID",
      "name": "Docs",
      "path": "projects/docs/Avo.ts",
      "actionId": "<LAST_UPDATED_ID>",
      "branchId": "<LAST_UPDATED_BRANCH_ID>",
      "updatedAt": "<LAST_UPDATED_TIMESTAMP>"
    },
    {
      "id": "SOURCE_ID",
      "name": "Web App",
      "path": "projects/web/Avo.ts",
      "actionId": "<LAST_UPDATED_ID>",
      "branchId": "<LAST_UPDATED_BRANCH_ID>",
      "updatedAt": "<LAST_UPDATED_TIMESTAMP>"
    },
    {
      "id": "SOURCE_ID",
      "name": "Transactions Microservice",
      "path": "projects/transactions/Avo.ts",
      "actionId": "<LAST_UPDATED_ID>",
      "branchId": "<LAST_UPDATED_BRANCH_ID>",
      "updatedAt": "<LAST_UPDATED_TIMESTAMP>"
    },
    {
      "id": "SOURCE_ID",
      "name": "iOS",
      "path": "projects/iOS/Avo.swift",
      "actionId": "<LAST_UPDATED_ID>",
      "branchId": "<LAST_UPDATED_BRANCH_ID>",
      "updatedAt": "<LAST_UPDATED_TIMESTAMP>"
    },
    {
      "id": "SOURCE_ID",
      "name": "Android",
      "path": "projects/Android/Avo.kt",
      "actionId": "<LAST_UPDATED_ID>",
      "branchId": "<LAST_UPDATED_BRANCH_ID>",
      "updatedAt": "<LAST_UPDATED_TIMESTAMP>"
    }
  ]
}
```
