# How to read the implementation diff

First thing you need to know is that tracking design happens on branches in Avo. When a new feature is built, the tracking plan manager opens a branch in Avo and plans all the new tracking there.
This allows us to show you the diff - what should be implemented for a specific feature.

To see the diff press the "View changes" panel in the sidebar.

### Sources

All changes are grouped by source. That makes it easy to split the instructions down by source, enabling you to share the instructions in separate tasks for each source.

### Global event properties

Some event properties are configured to be sent with every event. Changes in global properties are listed first.

### Events

All events that have been modified on the branch are included in the instructions. Events can have three states: New, Removed or Updated. For every event you can see the description and a link to the event in Avo, in addition to properties and destinations.

### Properties

Each event in the instructions has a list of the properties attached to it. Properties can have four states: New, Removed, Updated or Existing (no change). For every property you can see the property description as defined in Avo. Properties are categorized into event, user and group properties, so you can handle each type differently.

### Destinations

Each event in the instructions has a list of the destinations it should be sent to. Destinations can have three states: New, Removed or Existing. If the event, or any of its properties, has a per-destination [name mapping](/data-design/name-mapping) applied, they will be listed in this section.

>
> Some event properties are configured to be sent with all events. Make sure to include those on this event. Learn more about the properties sent with all events above.
> There are changes in some event properties that are sent with all events. Learn more about the properties sent with all events above.

## What's next?

Next feature we recommend to explore is setting up [the webhook](/implementation/avo-tracking-plan-webhook) that's triggered when a branch is merged.
