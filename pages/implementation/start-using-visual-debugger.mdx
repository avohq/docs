# Setup Avo Visual Debugger in code

When implementing analytics on web and mobile apps itâ€™s hard to know if the events are being sent successfully or not, and if they are being sent at the correct time.

Our Visual Debuggers provide a way to control the events flow in your app, making implementing analytics way easier and pleasant in web and mobile products.

Web Visual debugger is integrated into the Avo generated file and mobile debuggers are distributed as standalone open source libraries.

Each Avo function will automatically show events in the debugger with timestamp and all the properties.

If Avo detects errors the visual debugger will highlight those.
