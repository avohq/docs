When implementing analytics on web and mobile apps it’s hard to know if the events are being sent successfully or not, and if they are being sent at the correct time.

Our Visual Debuggers provide a way to control the events flow in your app, making implementing analytics way easier and pleasant in web and mobile products.

Web Visual debugger is integrated into the Avo generated file and mobile debuggers are distributed as standalone open source libraries.

Each Avo function will automatically show events in the debugger with timestamp and all the properties.

If Avo detects errors the visual debugger will highlight those.

> Debuggers are disabled in the <Link passHref href="/implementation/avo-and-unit-tests"><a>noop</a></Link> mode

### Accessing the web debugger

The Web Debugger is on by default in development.

To disable the Web Debugger in development provide `webDebugger = false` to initAvo options:

```javascript
Avo.initAvo({ webDebugger: false, ... }, ...);
```

To access it in production add the `?avo_debug=1` query parameter to the URL.

### Setting up the mobile debuggers

> If you are using the Inspector SDK on iOS and Android the Visual Debugger is bundled with it, you do not need to do this setup! See `showVisualInspector` and `hideVisualInspector` methods of the Inspectos SDKs.

The following pseudocode would give you the idea, head to <a href="#platform-docs">platform docs</a> for specific integration instructions.

1. Create the debugger

```javascript
val debugger = Debugger()
```

2. Pass debugger when you initialize Avo, so Avo can show all tracked events

```javascript
Avo.initAvo(AvoEnv.DEV, ..., debugger)
```

3. Show the debugger

```javascript
debugger.showDebugger(this, DebuggerMode.bar)
```

4. Post your own events

```javascript
debugger.post(
    timestamp,
    "EventName",
    errors: [{propertyId:"id0", message:"error in property 'event prop' with id 'id0'"}],
    eventProperties: [{id:"id0", name:"event prop", value:"val"}],
    userProperties: [{id:"id1", name:"user prop", value:"val"}]
);
```
