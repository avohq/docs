Avo offers three ways to validate your tracking implementation:

1.  <a href="#avo-functions-type-safe-analytics-wrappers">Avo Functions: Type safe analytics wrappers</a>
2.  <a href="#avo-inspector-tracking-observability">Avo Inspector: Tracking observability</a>
3.  <a href="#avo-debuggers-aka-in-app-inspector-on-device-tracking-verification">Avo Debuggers aka In-App Inspector: On device tracking verification</a>


## Avo Functions: Type safe analytics wrappers

### What are Avo Functions?

<Link passHref href="/implementation/avo-functions-overview"><a>Avo Functions</a></Link> are 
type safe analytics wrappers that are code generated based on your <Link passHref href="/workspace"><a>tracking plan</a></Link>. <br/> <br/> 

Technical or non-technical people can define analytics event schemas in the <Link passHref href="/workspace"><a>Avo Tracking Plan</a></Link>, 
and you can generate human readable type safe code based on that. The days of unstructured 
and outdated tracking plan spreadsheets and Jira tickets are over 🥳 So are the days of brittle 
analytics implementation you have to revisit to fix again and again and again 😌

### How do Avo Functions work?

Avo Functions are type safe analytics wrappers that can work with any analytics tool, whether it's any of the third-party event logging SDKs (e.g. 
Google Analytics 4, Segment, RudderStack, mParticle, Snowplow, Amplitude, Mixpanel, Pendo, 
etc) or your home made API.

When designing the tracking plan you configure the list of analytics destinations for each source. In the generated code each destination is 
represented as its own Destination Interface in the initAvo method of your Avo Functions. This is how Avo Functions routes data, 
locally in your client (without the data ever going through Avo's servers), to the correct destination based on the source/destination connections 
you've defined in the Avo dashboard.

In the <Link passHref href="/workspace"><a>Avo Tracking Plan</a></Link> you can configure which analytics <Link passHref href="/workspace/tracking-plan/events#a-nameactionsa-actions"><a>actions</a></Link> 
should be triggered with an Avo Function (for example you might want to update user properties or log revenue along with logging an event), and the Avo Functions 
will handle calling all the relevant Destination Interface methods. All you have to do is call the Avo Function in your 
code base and pass in type safe key-value pairs, and the Avo Function will take care of the rest.

### Do events flow through Avo servers?

No. None of your events ever go through Avo servers. They go directly from your devices (whether that's 
a front-end client or a server) to the analytics destination.

> 💡 This sometimes called "device mode". With CDPs, you can choose between <Link passHref href="https://segment.com/docs/guides/intro-impl/#connection-modes"><a>_Cloud-mode_ or _Device-mode_</a></Link>:
> - In _Cloud-mode_, your events go through the CDP servers. Your devices send the events to the CDP cloud (aka the CDP Servers) and the CDP cloud sends them to the analytics destinations.
> - In _Device-mode_ the events go directly from your devices (whether it's a front end client or a server) to the analytics destination.
> In this regard, Avo works like _Device-mode_.

## Avo Inspector: Tracking Observability

### What is Avo Inspector?

Avo Inspector is a tracking observability solution that's easy to install. Avo Inspector analyzes tracking calls made by your app and provides an overview of them in the Inspector dashboard.

With Inspector, you get an instant audit of your current state of tracking, and an ongoing tracking observability going forward.

### How does Avo Inspector work?

The Inspector API extracts the schemas (aka shapes) of the events you trigger (no PII data, 
only event names, property names, and types of properties) and sends those schemas to 
the Avo servers. To repeat: None of the PII data ever flows through Avo servers; only event schemas.

### How do I use Inspector?

You can view the overview of your current tracking in the <Link passHref href="/workspace/inspector"><a>Inspector dashboard</a></Link> and you can connect Avo Inspector to a Slack channel to receive alerts when the Inspector detects 
a new issue that has not been seen in production for 30 days.

### How do I send data into the Inspector?

You can send data into Inspector three ways:

1.  <a href="#inspector-sdks">Inspector SDKs</a>
2.  <a href="#connect-with-cdps-and-analytics-platforms">Connect with CDPs and analytics platforms</a>
3.  <a href="#inspector-api">Inspector API (<Link passHref href="/help/troubleshooting"><a>contact us to get access</a></Link>)</a>


#### Inspector SDKs

The Inspector SDK can be plugged into your existing tracking – independent of whether 
you're using the Avo Functions or not.

##### Inspector SDK with your existing tracking

The Inspector SDK is a stand-alone SDK which you can install with your package manager.
You can use the Inspector SDK whether or not you adopt Avo Functions, by plugging the 
Inspector SDK into the call site of your existing tracking. Most code bases 
have some sort of a wrapper around calling their analytics SDKs, and that's where you 
plug the Inspector SDK.

##### Inspector SDK with Avo Functions

Initialize the Avo Functions SDK with an instance of the Inspector SDK.

#### Connect with CDPs and analytics platforms

You can pipe your analytics data into the Inspector API via your CDPs or analytics providers:

- Segment: <Link passHref href="/workspace/connect-inspector-to-segment"><a>Set Inspector up via Segment Functions</a></Link>
- RudderStack: <Link passHref href="/workspace/connect-inspector-to-rudderstack"><a>Set Inspector up via RudderStack Functions</a></Link>
- PostHog: <Link passHref href="/workspace/connect-inspector-to-posthog"><a>Set Inspector up via PostHog Plugin</a></Link>
- Mixpanel: Coming soon.
- mParticle: Coming soon.

Reach out to support@avo.sh for early access to any of the platforms coming soon.

#### Inspector API

Coming soon: You can send data into the Inspector API directly. Reach out to support@avo.sh for early access.

### Does Inspector receive PII data?

No. Inspector does not receive any PII data. Inspector only takes in event names, 
property names, and types of properties.

## Avo Debuggers aka In-App Inspector: On device tracking verification

Avo provides an <Link passHref href="/implementation/start-using-visual-debugger"><a>In-App Inspector</a></Link> that shows you when you're triggering events, what the schemas are,
and whether they match the analytics event spec. The In-App Inspector is displayed via a small bubble 
on your web or mobile app, which you can click into and see the details of the event structure.

When you implement analytics via the <a href="#avo-functions-type-safe-analytics-wrappers">Avo Functions</a>, the In-App Inspector will not only show you 
the timing and schema of your event, but also display a red warning or green check mark based on 
whether or not your events fits the analytics spec in your Avo tracking plan.
