The [Avo command line interface](https://github.com/avohq/avo) provides a way to pull custom analytics wrappers from Avo. The CLI is designed to make developers more productive when implementing analytics.

## Quickstart

### Step 1: Install the Avo CLI

```bash
$ npm install -g avo
```

After installing, verify everything is in working order by running `avo --version`.

```bash
$ avo --version
1.3.6
```

### Step 2: Link your Avo account

Once you have installed the Avo CLI, run `avo login` to link your Avo account with the CLI.

```bash
$ avo login
```

After you have successfully linked your account, run `avo whoami` to see the linked account.

```bash
$ avo whoami
Logged in as my@account.com
```

### Step 3: Pull generated analytics wrappers from Avo

To pull generated analytics wrappers from Avo, run `avo pull`. It will fetch the latest analytics wrappers based on your tracking plan on avo.app.

When you run this command for the first time it will prompt you to select which Avo source you would like to generate code for and where you would like to save it. This configuration will be stored in the `avo.json` file and you can always change it later.

Please commit the `avo.json` file into your version control, in order to keep it in sync across your team.

```bash
$ avo pull
```

### Step 4: Monitor the analytics implementation

Once you have implemented analytics with the Avo analytics wrappers, you can check the status of the implementation by running `avo status`.

The `status` command will report on where the analytics functions provided by Avo are being called, and which events have not been implemented yet.

```bash
$ avo status
```

## Using Avo Branches

When editing your tracking plan on avo.app you can branch out from the main tracking plan to make changes in isolation, just like with git. To pull analytics wrappers from an open Avo branch you first need to switch to that branch with `avo checkout`.

```bash
$ avo checkout my-branch-name
```

You can also pull from a specific branch by using the `--branch` flag when running `avo pull`

```bash
$ avo pull [my-source-name] --branch my-branch-name
```

### Using an Avo branch with a git branch

Here is the workflow we recommend when working on Avo branches with git branches.

1. On your git branch, pull updated analytics wrappers from the Avo branch you would like to implement

```bash
$ avo pull [my-source-name] --branch my-branch-name
```

2. Once ready to merge, make sure your Avo branch is up to date with Avo main by pulling latest main changes into your branch. This can also be done from the branch review screen on avo.app.
   If any changes were pulled in, make sure to run `avo pull` again to update the analytics wrappers

```bash
$ avo merge main
```

3. Review and merge your git branch

4. Immediately after merging the git branch, merge the Avo branch from the branch review screen on avo.app

## Git Conflicts in Avo Files

To resolve git conflicts in `avo.json` run `avo pull`. It will attempt to resolve the git conflicts in `avo.json` automatically and check whether the incoming branch has been merge and if your current branch is up to date with Avo main before pulling latest analytics wrappers.

```bash
$ avo pull
```

As an alternative you can also run `avo conflict`, it will resolve any conflicts in `avo.json` without pulling latest analytics wrappers.

```bash
$ avo conflict
```
