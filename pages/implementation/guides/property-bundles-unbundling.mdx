# Property bundles in Avo Codegen

In Avo you can bundle multiple event properties that are commonly used together into a property bundle.

Property bundles allow you to increase the consistency of your tracking plan as well as increasing efficiency when defining new events and implementing them.

## Example

In Avo we have a property bundle called "Source", that includes 2 properties: "Source Id" and "Source Name".

We add this property bundle to any event that is related to a source instead of adding those 2 properties manually every time.

Property bundles can include more than 2 properties, there is no upper limit.

## Property bundles in Avo Codegen

When generating code for a tracking plan with property bundles the property bundles can be in 2 states:

- Bundled: in this case we can represent a property bundle as an object in the code. Every property included into the property bundle becomes a field of the object.

- Unbundled: in this case all the properties from the property bundle are added to the event tracking function as if the properties were added individually to the event in Avo.

Property bundles are currently supported in 4 languages: Kotlin, Swift, Objective-C and Rescript/ReasonML. Codegen for these languages will generate bundled properties, unless they have to be force unbundled. [Contact us](/help/troubleshooting) if you want to force unbundle all property bundles in your workspace.

### Force property bundle unbundling

Sometimes a change in the tracking plan can cause a property bundle to be force unbundled.

This happens if the property bundle data structure can not be represented as a specific type in the programming language anymore.

One reason for that is when the property absence varies between different events.

In that case a property can be optional on one event and required on another event.

This circumstance makes it impossible to represent this property bundle type as a class in the code, because one filed of that class should be optional under one condition and non optional under another.

When this happen we unbundle the property bundle, so each event can get granular property presence.
