# Handling anonymous and identified users in the client and on the server

## User identity in the client side Codegen

### Anonymous users

When working with anonymous users, analytics SDKs automatically assign anonymous user ids on a per-client level.
When a user is identified the anonymous events are associated with the identified user.
You don't need to do additional actions for this logic to work on the client side, so you are not required to provide `anonymousUserId` anywhere.

### Identified users

Client side Analytics SDKs can store the information about the currently logged in user.
It makes possible to identify user once and then send all subsequent tracking calls on behalf of the identified user.

To make an Avo function identify a user you add the Identify action to the corresponding Avo event in your tracking plan. [Learn more about the Identify action](/data-design/avo-tracking-plan/events#identify-user).

Codegen corresponding to the events with Identify action will require a userId parameter automatically.

## User identity in the server side Codegen

Server side Codegen does not inherently maintain user identity, so it requires to specify the identifying id value for each event.
The codegen will automatically add two parameters to every Avo function in server side environments: `anonymous_id_` and `user_id`.

### Anonymous users

Anonymous id is an id to associate with non identified users, e.g. your device id. 
In Avo functions generated for events that do not have `Identify` action, both `anonymous_id_` and `user_id` are optional, so you can provide one. 
For non identified users provide the value of the `anonymous_id_` and set `user_is_` to null.

> Workspaces created before July 2023 might not get `anonymous_id_` parameters in the generated Avo functions, run `avo pull` with the `--forceFeatures ServerTrackingWithDeviceId` flag to include the parameter. You can [contact us](/help/troubleshooting) to have it enabled by default.

### Identified users

User id is the id of an identified user.
In Avo functions generated for events that do not have `Identify` action, both `anonymous_id_` and `user_id` are optional, so you can provide one. 
For identified users provide the value of the `user_id_` and set `anonymous_id_` to null.
Alternatively, some SDKs allow you to keep the `anonymous_id_` and use both when calling the SDK, like (Mixpanel)[https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/tracking-methods/id-management/identifying-users-simplified#server-side-identity-management]

> Though both `anonymousUserId` and `userId` are optional make sure to provide at least one of them to be able to identify the user.

### Identify action in server side codegen

If you add an `Identify` action to an event in Avo, the generated code with create an Avo function that requires both `anonymous_id_` and `user_id`.
It should happen at the moment when the user gets identified and the `anonymous_id_` should be associated with the `user_id_`.
Some SDKS require you to perform the identification manually, other do it automatically. An example of the manual case is (Mixpanel's old approach)[https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/identity-create-alias] to user identification

> Server side codegen uses the `logEvent` callback in this case. `logEvent` will provide non-null values for both `anonymous_id_` and `user_id`.
> Make sure to include `Log Event` and `Identify` action on the server side events.
