# Create Branch

_Create a new branch using Avo API_

The Create Branch API allows you to programmatically create new branches in your Avo workspace.

## Endpoint

```Url
POST https://api.avo.app/workspaces/:workspaceId/branches/v1
```

`:workspaceId` is the ID of your workspace. You'll find it in the URL of your avo tab after `/schemas/`.

### Authentication

This endpoint requires an [authorization header](/public-api/authentication#authenticating-with-avo-api) containing a Base64 encoded service account name and secret.

### Rate Limit

We currently soft-enforce 1/req/s rate limit per service account for this endpoint. Please reach out to us if you have a use case in mind that requires a higher rate limit.

## Parameters

### - workspaceId

Locate your workspaceId in the URL
`avo.app/schemas/:workspaceId`

### - Base64 encoding secret header

The base64 encoded token expects `name:secret`

See more on [authorization](/public-api/authentication#authenticating-with-avo-api)
