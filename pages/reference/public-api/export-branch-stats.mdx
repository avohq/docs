# Export Branch stats

_Export branch stats using Avo API_

The Export API gives you the possibility to export your Avo branches as CSV.

## Endpoint

```Url
https://api.avo.app/workspaces/:workspaceId/branches/export/v1
```

`:workspaceId` is the ID of your workspace. You'll find it in the URL of your avo tab after `/schemas/`.

Returns [a CSV string that is a representation of your branch stats for all branches in the workspace]

CSV Headers

- `branchName`: Name of the branch
- `branchId`: Id of the branch
- `branchCreatorId`: userId of the branch creator
- `branchCreatorEmail`: email of the branch creator
- `creationDate`: UTC timestamp when the branch was created
- `branchStatus`: current status on the branch [Merged | Closed | Approved | Draft | ReadyForReview]
- `collaborators`: array of user emails that helped on the branch.
- `lastPublishedDate`: UTC timestamp of last time when the branch was published to a downstream publishing integration
- `markedReadyForReviewDate`: UTC timestamp when the branch was marked as ReadyForReview. This will return the date of the first ReadyForReview event.
- `markedReadyForReviewerUserEmail`: email of the user who marked the branch as ReadyForReview. This will return the email of the user who first marked the branch as ReadyForReview.
- `branchMergedDate`: UTC timestamp when the branch was merged
- `branchMergedUserEmail`: email of the user who merged the branch.
