# Import Tracking Plan

_Import tracking plan using Avo API_

The Import API allows you to import a tracking plan from a CSV file into a specific branch in your Avo workspace.

## Endpoint

```Url
https://api.avo.app/workspaces/:workspaceId/branches/:branchId/import/v1
```

`:workspaceId` is the ID of your workspace. You'll find it in the URL of your avo tab after `/schemas/`. `:branchId` is the ID of the branch you want to import into. If you open a branch in Avo you can find it in the URL after `/branches/`. For the main branch simply use `main`. Note that the branch id is not the same as the branch name.

> **Important Restrictions:**
>
> - You cannot import directly to the main branch if the "Protected main branch" setting is enabled in your workspace
> - You cannot import to a branch that is closed or merged

### Authentication

This endpoint requires an [authorization header](/public-api/authentication#authenticating-with-avo-api) containing a Base64 encoded service account name and secret.

### Rate Limit
