# Set up Avo Mobile Visual Debugger in code

Mobile debuggers are distributed as standalone open source libraries.

Each Avo function will automatically show events in the debugger with timestamp and all the properties.

If Avo detects errors the visual debugger will highlight those.

> Debuggers are disabled in the [noop](/implementation/avo-and-unit-tests) mode

### Setting up the mobile debuggers

> If you have already initialized Inspector SDK on iOS and Android, no further action is required to enable the Visual Debugger. See `showVisualInspector` and `hideVisualInspector` methods of Inspector SDKs to start using the Visual Debugger.

The following pseudocode would give you the idea, head to [platform docs](#platform-docs) for specific integration instructions.

1. Create the debugger

```javascript
val debugger = Debugger()
```

2. Pass debugger when you initialize Avo, so Avo can show all tracked events

```javascript
Avo.initAvo(AvoEnv.DEV, ..., debugger)
```

3. Show the debugger

```javascript
debugger.showDebugger(this, DebuggerMode.bar)
```

4. Post your own events

```javascript
debugger.post(
    timestamp,
    "EventName",
    errors: [{propertyId:"id0", message:"error in property 'event prop' with id 'id0'"}],
    eventProperties: [{id:"id0", name:"event prop", value:"val"}],
    userProperties: [{id:"id1", name:"user prop", value:"val"}]
);
```
