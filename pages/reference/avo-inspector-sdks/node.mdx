## Quick Start Guide

Find the Quick Start Guide in our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/avohq/node-avo-inspector">GitHub repo.</a>

## Installation

The library is distributed with NPM, install with npm:

```bash
$ npm i node-avo-inspector
```

or yarn:

```bash
$ yarn add node-avo-inspector
```

## Import

```ts
import * as Inspector from "node-avo-inspector";
```

## Initialization

Obtain the API key in Inspector tab in your <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.avo.app/welcome">Avo.app workspace</a>.

You will need to create an instance of **AvoInspector** with the constructor:

```ts
constructor(options: {
    apiKey: string;
    env: AvoInspectorEnv;
    version: string;
    appName?: string;
});
```

All the following methods are available in the **AvoInspector** class.

> #### Parameters:
>
> - `apiKey` - the API key you get in your Avo account
> - `env` - current environment: `"dev"`, `"staging"` or `"prod"`
> - `appVersion` - your application version. A lot of Inspector features rely on versioning and you need to provide a comparable string here to get value from them. We recommend using semantic versioning or integers that are incremented in every release.
> - `appName` - your application name. Optional; Provide it to make it easier to distinguish between data from different apps.

## Sending event schemas to Avo Inspector

This is the core of the **Avo Inspector SDK**.

```ts
trackSchemaFromEvent(eventName: string, eventProperties: {
    [propName: string]: any;
}): void;
```

> #### Parameters:
>
> - `eventName` - string event name, also known as event type.
> - `eventProperties` - The actual event properties, which will be converted to an event schema on the device and the event schema sent to **Avo**. The resulting keys will be object field names and the values will be object field value types converted to schema types.
>
> ##### Example format:
>
> ```js
> var eventProperties = {
>   userId: 1337,
>   emailAddress: 'jane.doe@avo.app',
>   key: 'value',
> };
> ```

## Configuring Logs

`enableLogging` controls printing of tracked event schemas and other helpful information to logcat. Enabled by default in development environments.

```js
enableLogging(enable: boolean): void;
```

> #### Parameters:
>
> - `enable` - boolean flag that sets whether **Avo Inspector SDK** will print logs
>   .
