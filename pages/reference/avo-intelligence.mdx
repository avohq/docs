# Avo Intelligence

Avo Intelligence enhances your workspace with powerful AI-driven features, like **Smart Search**, to make working with your Tracking Plan faster and more intuitive. By enabling Avo Intelligence, you unlock current and future AI-powered tools, starting with **Smart Search**.

## Smart Search

**Smart Search** makes discovering items in your tracking plan a breeze. It goes beyond exact matches to provide smarter, AI-powered suggestions. Search for terms like *"completed"* and get results such as *"Order Placed"* or *"Task Finished"*.

- **Quickly navigate large schemas.** A lifesaver for new team members or anyone working with extensive Tracking Plans.
- **Avoid duplicates.** Spot existing events and properties before creating new ones.

- Properties  
- Property bundles  
- Categories
