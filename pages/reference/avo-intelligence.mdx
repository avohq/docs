# Avo Intelligence

Avo Intelligence enhances your workspace with powerful AI-driven features, like **Smart Search**, to make working with your Tracking Plan faster and more intuitive. By enabling Avo Intelligence, you unlock current features like **Smart Search**. As we roll out more functionality, we‚Äôll notify you in advance if we start sharing other types of data with AI models, or if we begin using AI providers other than OpenAI.

## Smart Search

**Smart Search** makes discovering items in your tracking plan a breeze. It goes beyond exact matches to provide smarter, AI-powered suggestions. Search for terms like _"completed"_ and get results such as _"Order Placed"_ or _"Task Finished"_.

- **Quickly navigate large schemas.** A lifesaver for new team members or anyone working with extensive Tracking Plans.
- **Avoid duplicates.** Spot existing events and properties before creating new ones.
