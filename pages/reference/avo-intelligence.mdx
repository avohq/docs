# Avo Intelligence

Avo Intelligence enhances your workspace with powerful AI-driven features, like **Smart Search**, to make working with your Tracking Plan faster and more intuitive. By enabling Avo Intelligence, you unlock current and future AI-powered tools, starting with **Smart Search**.

## Smart Search

**Smart Search** makes discovering items in your tracking plan a breeze. It goes beyond exact matches to provide smarter, AI-powered suggestions. Search for terms like _"completed"_ and get results such as _"Order Placed"_ or _"Task Finished"_.

- **Quickly navigate large schemas.** A lifesaver for new team members or anyone working with extensive Tracking Plans.
- **Avoid duplicates.** Spot existing events and properties before creating new ones.

  Note: After first enabling smart search, it can take up to 5 minutes to index
  the workspace items into a searchable database, so grab a ‚òï and then come
  back and enjoy improved search üîç

## Privacy and Data Use

Avo only shares necessary schema items to power features like Smart Search. Your data is not used to power search in other Avo workspaces, nor used for training or improving external models.

## Coming soon

By enabling Avo Intelligence, you'll automatically unlock future AI-powered features as they become available. For example:

- Improved discovery of existing items when creating events, properties, and metrics
- Surfacing common patterns in your tracking plan to speed up fleshing out events
