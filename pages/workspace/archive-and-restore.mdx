In Avo you can archive items that you don't want in your tracking plan anymore. You can archive events, properties, property groups, sources, destinations, categories, metrics and group types.

### How do I archive an item?

  />
</center>

In the top right corner of the item you want to archive, click the `...` menu and select the "Archive ..." option.

### Restoring an item

When an item is archived it is moved from your tracking plan to an archive store within your Avo workspace. Archived items are currently not accessible from the tracking plan UI but can be restored from the Activity log.

<center>
  <img
    src={require('../../images/workspace/restore-archive.png')}
    alt="Restore item from archive from the Activity Log in Avo"
  />
</center>

Find the archive activity in <a href="https://www.avo.app/schemas/default">the Activity Log of your workspace</a>, click the `...` menu on the item and select "Restore". Make sure you are on the branch the item was archived, both the workspace itself and the activity log.
