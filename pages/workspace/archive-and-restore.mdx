import Link from '../../components/Link';

In Avo you can archive items that you don't want in your tracking plan anymore. You can archive events, properties, property groups, sources, destinations, categories, metrics and group types.

### How do I archive an item?

<center>
  <img
    src={require('../../images/workspace/archive.png')}
    alt="Archive option on an event in Avo"
  />
</center>

In the top right corner of the item you want to archive, click the `...` menu and select the "Archive ..." option.

When an item is archived it is moved from your tracking plan to an archive store within your Avo workspace. Archived items are currently not accessible from the tracking plan UI.

<center>
  <img
    src={require('../../images/workspace/restore-archive.png')}
    alt="Restore item from archive from the Activity Log in Avo"
  />
</center>

Find the archive activity in <a href="https://www.avo.app/schemas/default">the Activity Log of your workspace</a>, click the `...` menu and select "Restore".
