The Inspector events view provides a report on all event tracking Inspector has seen in your development, staging and production environments. You can use the dashboard to evaluate the health of your tracking implementation and prioritize issues.

### Filters

Here you can choose which environment to examine, the time window and search for event name.

#### Environments

Currently Inspector supports 3 types of environments:

- Development
- Staging
- Production

The events are streamed to the Environment specified in the client, based on the environment constant provided when initializing Avo Inspector SDK.

> Development and Staging events appear in the dashboard in a few minutes after they are fired and Production events can take up to 2 hours to show up.

#### Time window

Currently Inspector supports 4 types of time windows:

- 1 hour
- 24 hours
- 7 days
- 30 days

Time windows are updated every few hours on Production and are close to real time in Development and Staging.

#### Search for event name

Type the event name in the input field and only events with similar name will be shown.

If you want an exact match put the event name in quotes, e.g. "App Opened".

### Share current view of Inspector

Notice that after you change the header filters the URL also changes. You can share this URL with a colleague and they would see exactly the same slice of inspector data as you filtered.

### Events list

The main part of Inspector events view is the list of all events seen. You can expand the events to see the event properties.

If Inspector sees an event that is not yet in your tracking plan there is a shortcut to add it to your Tracking plan.

If Inspector detects an issue it will indicate that in the list.

If you select an event or property row a panel with detailed information will appear on the right. There you would be able to see extended information about the issues and edit the event or property in your tracking plan.

##### Unknown Source

Sources that are not defined on the Tracking Plan branch you're on, will show up as "Unknown Source" columns in the event table. Unknown sources can show up if:

1. The source has been archived in Avo
2. The source was created on a branch that is yet to be merged to the branch you're currently on
