The first step to start using Inspector, is installing it on your sources. Inspector shares sources with the workspace sources and they are all set up in the Sources tab. You can find the source setup in Inspector <Link passHref href="/workspace/inspector/inspector-issues-view"><a>Issues view</a></Link> and the <Link passHref href="/workspace/inspector/inspector-events-view"><a>Events view</a></Link> by clicking "+ Add Source" or navigate to the "Sources" tab directly.

The Sources tab shows a list of all sources that have already been created and the status of Inspector setup. Once Inspector has been successfully installed, the set up status will be updated accordingly.

If the source you want to set up isn't already in the list of source, you can create a new one by clicking "Add Source". Check out our Connections Setup docs to learn more about <Link passHref href="/data-design/define-sources-and-destinations#sources">setting up and configuring sources </Link>

Each Inspector source has 3 states:

1. Receiving events - this source already received at least one event from the client SDK.
