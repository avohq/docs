Press the `Connect to Slack` button and follow the instructions.

Avo Inspector will post new issues it finds in production hourly to the specified slack channel.

The Inspector Slack integration currently alerts on the following issues:

- Property is sometimes not provided
- Property is sent with inconsistent types
- New event seen that is not in the Tracking Plan
- New property seen that is not in the Tracking Plan
- Property type does not match the Tracking Plan

## Overview

### Header filters

Here you can choose which environment to examine, the time window and search for event name.

#### Environments

Currently Inspector supports 3 types of environments:

- Development
- Staging
- Production

The events are streamed to the Environment specified in the client, based on the environment constant provided when initializing the Avo Inspector SDK.

> Development and Staging events appear in the dashboard in a few minutes after they are fired and Production events can take up to 2 hours to show up.

#### Time window

Currently Inspector supports 4 types of time windows:

- 1 hour
- 24 hours
- 7 days
- 30 days

All the time windows are updated hourly on Production and are close to real time in Development and Staging.

#### Search for event name

Type the vent name in the input field and only events with similar name will be shown.

If you want an exact match put the event name in quotes, i.e. "App Opened".

### Share current view of Inspector

Notice that after you change the header filters the URL also changes. You can share this URL with a collegue and they would see exactly the same slice of inspector data as you filtered.

### Events list

The main part of the View Events screen is the list of all events seen, after the specified filters are applied.

You can expand the events to see the event properties.

If Inspector sees an event that is not yet in your tracking plan there is a shortcut to add it to your Tracking plan.

If Inspector detects an issue it will indicate that in the list.

If you select an event or property row a panel with detailed information will appear on the right. There you would be able to see extended information about the issues and edit the event or property in your tracking plan.
