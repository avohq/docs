The first step to better analytics governance is knowing what's wrong with your data today.

We built the Inspector to help you understand how your current tracking is performing. The Inspector both identifies <Link passHref href="/explore-tracking-plan/issue-types-in-inspector">common issues in your existing tracking</Link>, such as inconsistent properties and types, and provides implementation status in the Avo Tracking Plan, so you always know the state of your tracking implementation in your app.

In this doc we'll be covering how to configure and use the Inspector in your workspace. You can learn about <Link passHref href="/implementation/avo-inspector-sdk-reference">how to install the Inspector SDKs in your sources here</Link>.

## Configuring Sources

The first step to start using the Inspector, is installing it on your sources. Inspector shares sources with the workspace sources and they are all set up in the Sources tab. You can find the source setup in the Inspector tab by clicking "Manage Sources" or navigate to the "Sources" tab directly.

    alt="Opening a branch"
  />
</center>

The Sources tab shows a list of all sources that have already been created and the status of the Inspector setup. Once Inspector has been successfully installed, the set up status will be updated accordingly.

If the source you want to set up isn't already in the list of source, you can create a new one by clicking "Add Source". Check out our Connections Setup docs to learn more about <Link passHref href="/data-design/define-sources-and-destinations#sources">setting up and configuring sources </Link>

Each Inspector source has 3 states:
1. Receiving events - this source already received at least one event from the client SDK.

  <img
    src={require('../../images/workspace/connection-setup/inspector-not-available.png')}
    alt="Inspector not available"
    width="60%"
  />
</center>
2. Inspector available - the source is available for Inspection, but have not received any events yet. Click the source and find the Inspector Setup section of the source details to see the implementations details and the API key for this source.
<center>
  <img
    src={require('../../images/workspace/connection-setup/inspector-listening.png')}
    alt="Inspector listening"
    width="60%"
  />
</center>
3. Inspector Not available - this source is not supported, there is no client SDK yet. Please <Link passHref href="/help/troubleshooting"><a>contact us</a></Link> to learn current status and planned release date.

  <img
    src={require('../../images/workspace/connection-setup/inspector-receiving-events.png')}
    alt="Inspector receiving events"
    width="60%"
  />
</center>


## Connect to Slack

Inspector tab you can connect Inspector to your Slack to receive alerts when new issues appear in your production environments.

Press the `Connect to Slack` button and follow the instructions.

<center>
  <img
    src={require('../../images/workspace/nav-inspector-slack-highlighted.png')}
    alt="Inspector receiving events"
    width="100%"
  />
</center>

Avo Inspector will post new issues it finds in production hourly to the specified slack channel.

The Inspector Slack integration currently alerts on the following issues:

- Property is sometimes not provided
- Property is sent with inconsistent types
- New event seen that is not in the Tracking Plan
- New property seen that is not in the Tracking Plan
- Property type does not match the Tracking Plan

## Inspector Dashboard

The Inspector dashboard provides a report on all tracking the Inspector has seen in your development, staging and production environment. You can use the dashboard to evaluate the health of your tracking implementation and prioritize issues.

### Filters

Here you can choose which environment to examine, the time window and search for event name.

#### Environments

Currently Inspector supports 3 types of environments:
- Development
- Staging
- Production

The events are streamed to the Environment specified in the client, based on the environment constant provided when initializing the Avo Inspector SDK.

> Development and Staging events appear in the dashboard in a few minutes after they are fired and Production events can take up to 2 hours to show up.

#### Time window

Currently Inspector supports 4 types of time windows:

- 1 hour
- 24 hours
- 7 days
- 30 days

All the time windows are updated hourly on Production and are close to real time in Development and Staging.

#### Search for event name

Type the event name in the input field and only events with similar name will be shown.

If you want an exact match put the event name in quotes, e.g. "App Opened".

### Share current view of Inspector

Notice that after you change the header filters the URL also changes. You can share this URL with a colleague and they would see exactly the same slice of inspector data as you filtered.

### Events list

The main part of the Inspector dashboard screen is the list of all events seen.

You can expand the events to see the event properties.

If Inspector sees an event that is not yet in your tracking plan there is a shortcut to add it to your Tracking plan.

If Inspector detects an issue it will indicate that in the list.

If you select an event or property row a panel with detailed information will appear on the right. There you would be able to see extended information about the issues and edit the event or property in your tracking plan.
