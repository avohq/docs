The branch implement screen helps your team quickly and accurately implement tracking plan changes on a branch, allowing you start using the data or plan the next release. You can even share it with someone that's not part of your Avo workspace using the public sharing feature.

On the branch implement screen you see all events that are affected by your tracking plan changes, grouped by source. The event code snippet highlights exactly what has changed in the implementation of the event on the branch and makes it fast and easy for developers to understand what changes they need to make to successfully implement the branch. Your workspace members can comment directly no the events from the screen, quickly fleshing out any uncertainties about the changes. Your workspace members can comment directly on the events from the screen, quickly fleshing out any uncertainties about the changes. 

## Sharing

You can copy a link to the implementation instructions using the link (ðŸ”—) icon. It will include the current source, allowing you to tailor the link for each source that has to be implemented. If you want to focus on the implementation of a specific event, you can copy a link directly to it as well.

## Public sharing

If you are sharing implementation instructions with someone outside of your workspace or don't know if whoever might open the link is logged into Avo, you can create a public link.

The public view looks and functions similarly to the one in the workspace â€“ the only difference is that it's restricted to the code changes view only. The view is filtered down to source and you can switch between the sources affected by the tracking plan changes in the branch. You can configure the diff mode for the code snippets and copy the code for events implemented with Codegen and even copy a link to a specific event to send to anyone.

Workspace Admins and Editors can generate a public link right from the branch code changes view in the workspace. Once generated, anyone in the workspace can copy the link to share. We envision that this will become especially handy for those that create tracking implementation tasks in your task management tool and don't know if whoever will be looking at the task is already a member in your Avo workspace. Take a look at this [example public view](https://www.avo.app/s/TZ0YwKaQ9).

To maintain as much security and privacy as we can given the public access, we've gone to great lengths to expose nothing but the information necessary to display the code changes. All tracking plan calculations happen on the server side and we only send the browser the exact strings needed to display the page. Deleting a public link will permanently invalidate all existing links as generating a new one will be behind a new, unique share ID.


## Filtering View

While Reviewing, you can filter the events to help you focus on your context.
There are 2 filters

- By source
- By event implementation type (Codegen/Non-Codegen)

<div style={{height: '200px', width: '500px', display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'row'}}>

  alt="source filter"
/>

<div style={{ width: '50px' }} />

## Code Snippets

You can select how you want the code snippets changes displayed.
There are 3 options to select from to view the changes:

- Unified
- Split
- No diff

To show an example, we have an event called REACTION_REMOVED where we modified two properties.

- app_id: We changed the property type from `string` to `int`
- bot_id: We changed the property presence from `required` to `sometimes sent`

#### Unified

When viewing the events unified, the diff between main branch and your branch will be shown in the code snippet inline.

  alt="code snippet unified diff"
/>

#### Split

When viewing the events with split view, it will show the main state on the left hand side, while your current branch changes on the right hand side, with highlights on which properties were modified

<img
  src={require('../../images/code-changes/split-snippet.png')}
  width="80%"
  alt="code snippet split diff"
/>

#### No diff

When viewing the events with `No diff` view. The code snippet will display only the branch current changes.

  alt="code snippet no diff"
/>

## Codegen snippets

When reviewing sources that are using the Avo Codegen, the snippet will generate the function call to the Avo generated function created. The code snippet will be in the source's selected programming language and can be copy and pasted directly into code.

  width="100%"
  alt="Codegen code snippet"
/>

## Non-Codegen snippets

Events that are not implemented with codegen will also show code snippets.
These code snippets will be in Pseudocode to be used as a guide helper for the developer to implement the code.
The Pseudocodegen will attempt to display all the complexity that can be in implementing the event such as:

- Name mapping (overall and per destination)
- Multiple Destinations
- Property presence

> Pseudocodegen sets the property types as values for the properties to help the developer make sure to implement it correctly.
