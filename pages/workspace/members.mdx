Expand your Avo team and manage your members access by opening the members and permissions modal from the settings wheel located next to your workspace name:

  alt="Accessing members and permissions"
/>

## Roles

You can assign roles when inviting new users as well as for existing users, excluding yourself.

### View Only

Members with the _View Only_ role can access your workspace but cannot make any modifications and can not access workspace settings including the members and settings modal, audit log or billing page. Additionally, _View Only_ users don't have access to pull code generated Avo Functions with the Avo CLI. Assign the _View Only_ role to a member when you want to allow them to view your tracking plan but don't want them to be able to make changes. All new plans can add an unlimited amount of _View Only_ users.

### Comment Only

Members with a _Comment Only_ role have the same limitations as the _View Only_ role but can comment on events, properties, branches and more. The _Comment Only_ role is available on plans with extended collaboration, [see more](https://www.avo.app/pricing).

### Editor

Members with the _Editor_ role can make changes to your workspace like adding events and properties, changing property values and opening new branches. Editors can pull code generated Avo Functions using the Avo CLI. Editors can view other members but can not change their roles or add new ones and are not able to change your workspace name. On the growth and enterprise plans you can limit editor edits to just branches, requiring peer approval before the changes are merged to main:

/>

### Admin

Members with the _Admin_ role can change your workspace name, publish integrations, edit other members roles and invite new members. Admins can access the Audit Log, Billing page and the Workspace permissions. If the _protected main branch_ config is active, Admins can override merging a branch without approval.
