Metrics are used to measure the success of a feature. Usually more than one metrics are necessary to be able to evaluate the success of a feature. Example metrics for a feature that is meant to improve signup experience are:
Conversion to complete email step of the signup funnel
Conversion to complete signup
Proportion of daily active users that are signed up

Events are tied to metrics and can be thought as the building blocks of the metrics - the events necessary to be able to visualize the metric in your analytics tool. The metrics are therefore not only visible in the Metrics tab, but also in the event view. That way everyone can easily understand why this particular event should be track - because it is associated with a metric which is a part of a goal.
