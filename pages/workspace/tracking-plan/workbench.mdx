### What is the Workbench?

In Avo you can collaborate in real time on defining, expanding and implementing your tracking plan. Using <Link passHref href="/workspace/branches"><a>Branches</a></Link> helps you make your changes without disrupting your main source of truth with the power of approvals.

If you are already on a branch, all changes will be captured in the <Link passHref href="/workflow/review"><a>Review screen</a></Link> but the Events screen has a handy little summary at the top called the **Workbench** where you can have an overview of the changes you've made on your branch.

## Making changes

Events that are being changed or added will populate the Workbench as you go with a change summary at the top, along with the name of the branch. On the left, next to each event will be a colored line to indicate whether it is new (mint) or changed (purple).
