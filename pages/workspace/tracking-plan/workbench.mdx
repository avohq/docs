# Workbench

*A quick summary of the changes made to your events*

### What is the Workbench?

In Avo you can collaborate in real time on defining, expanding and implementing your tracking plan. Using [Branches](/workspace/branches) helps you make your changes without disrupting your main source of truth with the power of approvals.

If you are already on a branch, all changes will be captured in the [Review screen](/workflow/review) but the Events screen has a handy little summary at the top called the **Workbench** where you can have an overview of the changes you've made on your branch.

## Making changes

Events that are being changed or added will populate the Workbench as you go with a change summary at the top, along with the name of the branch. On the left, next to each event will be a colored line to indicate whether it is new (mint) or changed (purple).

Each event also has a colored line next to them to indicate the change state, mint for new events and purple for changed events.](/images/workflow/workbench/workbench.png)
