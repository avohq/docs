Publishing is where you can configure Avo to publish your Tracking Plan to your analytics platform, a production time validation tool or your own custom endpoint via webhook.

Available integrations are:

- <a href="#segment-protocols">Segment Protocols</a>
- <a href="#mixpanel-lexicon">Mixpanel Lexicon</a>
- <a href="#amplitude-govern">Amplitude Govern</a>
- <a href="#webhook">Webhook</a>

Publishing enables your Tracking Plan to be:

- Published whenever a branch is merged with Auto Publishing
- Published with a push of a button
- Downloaded from your Avo workspace on relevant format

## Publishing configuration

### Auto publishing

When Auto Publishing is enabled all changes made on a branch will be published to the integration when the branch is merged.

### Filtering events for publishing

You can customize which events in Avo are published to which integrations by using the events filter. Events can be filtered by Sources, Destinations and Tags. For example the following integration will only publish events sent from Web to Amplitude.

## <a name="segment-protocols"></a> Segment Protocols

The integration to [Segment Protocols](https://segment.com/docs/protocols) allows for your Tracking Plan to be published into Segment Protocols whenever branches are merged in your workspace or with a push of a button.

### Configure the Protocols integration

To enable the direct integration with Segment Protocols, you need to configure it with the following parameters from Segment.

- **Segment Workspace Name**: Found in the URL when logged into Segment: `https://app.segment.com/{Segment workspace name}/...`
- **Protocols Tracking Plan ID**: Found in the URL of the tracking plan page: starts with `rs_`
- **Segment Access Token**: [Create new API tokens](https://segment.com/docs/config-api/authentication/#create-an-access-token) for Avo and limit the scope of its permissions to ‘Protocol Admin’.

### Publishing to Protocols

Avo will override all events in the Protocols tracking plan that are being imported from Avo. Any changes made to an event in Protocols between Avo publish will be overridden on next Avo publish.

Avo will not override any events that are only defined in Protocols, or events that have not been added to the Protocols integration in Avo.

### Govern Publishing Errors

The following errors might occur when publishing your tracking to Govern. When publishing errors occur the error message in the Avo UI will contain which items could not be updated along with the error codes.

#### 404 Not Found

We tried to update an event that doesn't exist in your Amplitude Govern Schema. If this error occurs for all of the events you are attempting to publish it might indicate that your Amplitude Govern Schema has not been initialized. Learn more about initializing your Amplitude Govern Schema in [the Amplitude Govern docs](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047579451-Initialize-and-manage-the-Schema). If your Govern Schema has been initialized, and the error persists, please contact support.

#### 408 Timeout

The publishing operation took too long. This can happen when publishing large tracking plans for the first time. Click publish again to resume the publish, it will continue from where it left off.

#### 409 Conflict

We tried to update an item that doesn't exist in your Amplitude Govern Schema. This might be caused by an internal error. Please reach out to support so we can help you resolve the issue.

#### 429 Too Many Requests

We've exceeded the number of Govern requests we can make per hour for these API credentials. Please wait before trying to publish again. You can learn more about Amplitude Govern request limits [in the Amlitude Govern docs](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016606991-Taxonomy-API#h_53f1b7d4-ee8d-4a81-945b-e5a2909ddfad).


<img
  src={require('../../../images/publishing_webhook.svg')}
  alt="Webhook"
  style={{ margin: '32px 0 -32px 0' }}
/>

## <a name="webhook"></a> Webhook

The Webhook integration is a way to get updated Tracking Plan delivered to an endpoint of your choice when a branch is merge, or when the publish button is clicked in the integration interface.

### Configure the Webhook integration

To enable the Webhook integration you need to configure it with a URL where you want the updated tracking plan to be delivered.

The Tracking Plan will be delivered with a `POST` request containing the Tracking Plan on a [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/draft-06/schema#) format. The only requirement for this endpoint is to return a `200` response status code when it has successfully received the tracking plan.
