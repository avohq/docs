Import your existing tracking plan into Avo to get started quickly. The Importer supports multiple data formats and allows you to review and choose which events and properties you'd like to import.

When importing events that already exist in Avo, the importer will only import new properties, categories and tags for the event. The importer will never archive or delete existing events or properties, or remove properties, categories or tags from existing events.

## Importing from a Google Sheet

### Supported Formats

Following are the spreadsheet formats the Avo Importer currently supports.

We know that tracking plan spreadsheets come in all shapes and sizes. If you don't see your format
below you can try converting your existing spreadsheet to one of these formats,
by renaming columns etc, or you can [reach out to us](https://www.avo.app/docs/help/troubleshooting#contact-us) and we'll get the importing
done for you.

**Few things to note:**

- The order of the columns in your sheet does not matter
- There must be a header row in your sheet with the exact column names as described for one of the format below
- Any additional columns are ignored

You can learn more about common Tracking Plan spreadsheet formats [on our blog.](https://www.avo.app/blog/9-free-tracking-plan-templates-from-mixpanel-amplitude-segment-and-more)

## Troubleshooting

### **How do I prevent importing duplicates of my properties?**
The importer attempts to merge properties from imported events using the following criteria:
- The property name matches
- The property type matches
- The description matches

If these three criteria are not fulfilled, the importer doesn't merge the properties. The reason we
decided to include the description in this criteria is that a property that shares a name and a type,
can still have a totally different meaning based on the description, and documenting that
difference clearly in the tracking plan is critical to ensure everyone share the same understanding
of what the property should contain in different context.

In the case where you have aligned your names and types, but the description is different, you can:
- **If the properties should be merged and you are in a position to reset your tracking plan**: Unify the description in your import file, <Link passHref href="/workspace/reset-tracking-plan"><a>reset the tracking plan</a></Link>, and re-run the import. This will result in the properties being merged on import.
- **If the properties should be merged**: Use the <Link passHref href="/workspace/tracking-plan/properties#replacing-a-property"><a>"Replace property with..." feature</a></Link> in the context menu of the property modal
- **If the properties should not be merged**: Provide unique name and descriptions to better differentiate between these properties in the tracking plan
