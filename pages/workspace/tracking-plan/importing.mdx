## What to import

You can import your <Link passHref href="#importing-event-schemas"><a>event schemas</a></Link>, <Link passHref href="#import-user-properties"><a>user properties</a></Link>, <Link passHref href="#import-group-properties"><a>group properties</a></Link>, and <Link passHref href="#import-name-mapping"><a>name mapping</a></Link>.

### Import Tracking Plan

Import your existing event schemas, aka tracking plan, to get started
quickly.

> ðŸ’¡ When importing events that already exist in Avo, the importer will only import new properties, categories and tags for the event. The importer will never archive or delete existing events or properties, or remove properties, categories or tags from existing events. You can also import user properties, group properties, and name mapping.

See <Link passHref href="/workspace/tracking-plan/importing#tracking-plan-import-formats"><a>supported formats for importing event schemas, aka tracking plans</a></Link>.

### Import User Properties

> ðŸ’¡ **User properties** are helpful to segment behaviors by current state of
> users, as opposed to the state at the time of an event trigger. Read
> about <Link passHref href="/workspace/tracking-plan/properties#user-properties"><a>user property use cases and how they work</a></Link>.

See <Link passHref href="/workspace/tracking-plan/importing#user-property-import-format"><a>supported formats for importing user properties</a></Link>.

### Import Group Properties

> ðŸ’¡ **Group analytics** are important for b2b companies and can be useful in
> many other cases. Read about <Link passHref href="/workspace/data-design/groups"><a>group analytics use cases and how it works</a></Link>.

See <Link passHref href="/workspace/tracking-plan/importing#group-property-import-format"><a>supported formats for importing group properties</a></Link>.

### Import Name Mapping

> ðŸ’¡ **Different names to different destinations:** You
> might need to send events and properties with different names to different
> destinations if:
>
> **_a/ You have legacy event structures in specific analytics tools_**,
> which you can't change now because you need to data continuity in these
> tools.
>
> **_b/ Analytics destinations require specific event or property names_**
> for some functionality.
>
> Read more
> about <Link passHref href="/data-design/name-mapping"><a>name mapping</a></Link> and its <Link passHref href="/data-design/name-mapping#use-cases-for-name-mapping"><a>use cases</a></Link>.

names.

## Supported Formats

### Tracking Plan Import Formats

Following are the spreadsheet formats the Avo Importer currently supports.

We know that tracking plan spreadsheets come in all shapes and sizes. If you don't see your format
below you can try converting your existing spreadsheet to one of these formats,
by renaming columns etc, or you can <Link passHref href="/help/troubleshooting#contact-us"><a>reach out to us</a></Link> and
we'll get the importing done for you.

**Note:**

- The order of the columns in your sheet does not matter
- There must be a header row in your sheet with the exact column names as described for one of the format below
- Any additional columns are ignored

You can learn more about common Tracking Plan spreadsheet formats [on our blog.](https://www.avo.app/blog/9-free-tracking-plan-templates-from-mixpanel-amplitude-segment-and-more)

CSV format for importing.

> ðŸ’¡ **Optional: Associate user property to events** You can either attach user properties to events or import them without them
> being attached to events.
>
> 1. If you list events in this import that are not already in your tracking plan, Avo will also import those events.
>
> 2. If you want to attach user properties to events that are already in your Avo tracking plan, use the event name already in your Avo tracking plan. To reduce probability of import conflict, leave all other event related columns empty.
>
> 3. If you want to import user properties without associating them with an event, leave the event related columns empty

## Troubleshooting

### **How do I prevent importing duplicates of my properties?**

The importer attempts to merge properties from imported events using the following criteria:

- The property name matches
- The property type matches
- The description matches

If these three criteria are not fulfilled, the importer doesn't merge the properties. The reason we
decided to include the description in this criteria is that a property that shares a name and a type,
can still have a totally different meaning based on the description, and documenting that
difference clearly in the tracking plan is critical to ensure everyone share the same understanding
of what the property should contain in different context.

In the case where you have aligned your names and types, but the description is different, you can:

- **If the properties should be merged and you are in a position to reset your tracking plan**: Unify the description in your import file, <Link passHref href="/workspace/reset-tracking-plan"><a>reset the tracking plan</a></Link>, and re-run the import. This will result in the properties being merged on import.
- **If the properties should be merged**: Use the <Link passHref href="/workspace/tracking-plan/properties#replacing-a-property"><a>"Replace property with..." feature</a></Link> in the context menu of the property modal
- **If the properties should not be merged**: Provide unique name and descriptions to better differentiate between these properties in the tracking plan
