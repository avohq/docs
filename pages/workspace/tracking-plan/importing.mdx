## Importing from a Google Sheet

### Supported Formats

Following are the spreadsheet formats the Avo Importer currently supports.

We know that tracking plan spreadsheets come in all shapes and sizes. If you don't see your format
below you can try converting your existing spreadsheet to one of these formats,
by renaming columns etc, or you can [reach out to us](https://www.avo.app/docs/help/troubleshooting#contact-us) and we'll get the importing
done for you.

**Few things to note:**

- The order of the columns in your sheet does not matter
- There must be a header row in your sheet with the exact column names as described for one of the format below
- Any additional columns are ignored

You can learn more about common Tracking Plan spreadsheet formats [on our blog.](https://www.avo.app/blog/9-free-tracking-plan-templates-from-mixpanel-amplitude-segment-and-more)
