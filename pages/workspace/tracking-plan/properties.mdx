Properties are also known as traits, attributes, metadata, etc. They are information that is attached to events, users or groups that describe the state of the user or the product at the time of the event. Avo allows you to define event, group, user and system properties - each category described below.

## <a name="event-properties"></a> Event properties

Event properties describe the current state of your product at the time of the
event.

**Example**

For example the property "Game Mode" on the event "Game Started", is
relevant for that specific event, when you analyze your data. You might be want to correlate the completion rate of the game with the Game Mode, to decide how valuable the Game Modes are.

**Functionality**

Event properties are sent with the event in the <Link passHref href="/workspace/tracking-plan/events#a-namelog-eventa-log-event"><a>event call</a></Link>.

## <a name="group-properties"></a> Group properties

Group properties describe the state of a group you defined previously.

Similar to User properties, this information is usually relevant in a larger scope than for exactly that event.

**Example**

For B2B companies, products are used by multiple companies, each consisting of a number of users.
In that case, you can maintain the state of each company with group properties, increase the count of employees when a new user joins a particular company for example.

**Functionality**

Group properties are updated with the event in the <Link passHref href="/workspace/tracking-plan/events#a-nameupdate-groups"><a>Update Groups</a></Link> action.

### Managing Groups

To be able to manage a Group (update Group Properties, associate users or events with Groups)  you first need to define the Group:

#### Creating Group Types

You can create Group Types either from the Properties screen or from the
`Update Groups` action from the Event details.

* From the Properties screen click `+ Add Group Type`
* From the Update Groups action click `+ Add Group Type`

and fill in name and description of your Group Type.

> 💡 Tip: Each Group Type will need an ID for association (e.g. `Workspace`
> : `Avo`). If you would like to strictly define possible ids for a type
> (e.g. `Role` : [one of `Admin`, `Editor`, `Viewer`, etc.] you can choose
> `Property Id should match one of` and define your possibilities.

#### Creating Group properties

Group Properties are properties which belong to a specific group type (e.g.
Member Count for Group Type Workspace). There are also two ways to create
Group properties

* From the Properties screen, find the Group Properties section and your
Group Type's subsection and click `+ Add Group Property`
* From the Update Groups action choose the Group Type and then `+ Add Group Property`

and fill in name and description of your Group property.

Groups and Group properties should then be available from the `Update Groups`
action.

## <a name="user-properties"></a> User Properties

User properties describe the state of your user. It is information that is
usually relevant in a larger scope than for exactly that event.

**Example**

For example, you might want to correlate the Total Games Played of your users with how likely
they are to recommend your product to their friend, to make sure you ask them to
do that at the right time.

Some User Properties change rarely, such as "Email",
which mostly changes on Signup. And many analytics platforms support you in
analyzing all of your data by your user properties, while only sending them
along with your events when they actually change.

**Functionality**

User properties are updated with the <Link passHref href="/workspace/tracking-plan/events#a-nameupdate-user-propsa-update-user-properties"><a>Update User Properties action</a></Link>.

## <a name="system-properties"></a> System properties

System properties represent information that's relevant for all events that you send, and yet
do not describe the state of the user.

**Example**

For example, the user could alter between mobile and web platforms, so you would not necessarily have "Platform" be a user property that
gets overwritten each time the user switches platforms. Instead you could set
"Platform" to be a System Property in Avo, which are properties that we send
along with all events, as event properties for you. The values for such a property could be "Web App", "Desktop App", "iOS
App", "Android App", etc.

**Functionality**

System properties are set in the Avo.initAvo() function. They can be updated with `Avo.setSystemProperties()` if needed, but otherwise the values persist during the lifecycle of the application.

## <a name="property-groups"></a> Property groups

Property groups are a way to group two or more related properties to quickly and consistently add them to all related events.

An e-commerce website might want to attach all product properties to cart and checkout events.
An example property group could be "Product" containing the following properties:

- Product ID
- Product Name
- Product Price
- Product Quantity

## <a name="property-types-and-constraints"></a> Property types and constraints

In the property modal for event, user and system properties you need to define the type of the values allowed for the property. That definition is used to validate the property.

Avo supports properties with values of the following types and constraints:

- string _(enumeration of allowed values)_
- integer _(minimum and maximum value)_
- float _(minimum and maximum value)_
- boolean _(true or false)_

Properties values can also be a list of the above mentioned types:

- [‘foo’, ‘bar’]
- [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
- [1.2, 1.3, 1.6]
- [true, false, true, true, false]

## <a name="property-presence-configuration"></a> Configuring when Properties are required or optional

You can configure when Properties are required on a per-event and per-source basis. That means Avo will not give you an error if that property is missing from an event or source which the property is attached to, in other words it will sometimes be sent.

For per-event granularity you can choose between _Sometimes Sent_ or _Always Sent_.

    width="100%"
    alt="Image shows how to change property presence between events"
  />
</center>

For configuring per-event and per-source you can change the overall setting for the property to _Depending on Source_, revealing the sources available for each event for even more granular control.

    src={require('../../../images/property_presence_per_source_and_event.png')}
    width="100%"
    alt="Image shows how to change property presence between events"
  />
</center>

## <a name="snowplow-objects"></a> Snowplow Contexts

To set up a Snowplow object, the property has to be attached to an event that is being sent to Snowplow. This can be configured in the source configuration of an event. Then you can create a property and set it's type to an object. When you do that, then the option appears on the property to make it a Snowplow context. When you check that box, the code will be generated such that the object is converted to a Snowplow object.
You would need to define the schema id at this stage.

<center>
  <img
    src={require('../../../images/workspace/properties/snowplow-context-example.png')}
    width="60%"
    alt="Example of a Snowplow context definition in Avo"
  />
</center>

Here's how an individual Snowplow context is translated from what is defined in the UI to the context data structure:

```json
{
  "schema": "iglu:com.acme_company/product_context/jsonschema/1-0-0",
  "data": {
    "product_name": "product_name_value",
    "product_price": 10.0,
    "product_id": "product_id_value",
    "product_type": "product_type_value"
  }
}
```

Each Snowplow context defined on an event in Avo then added to form an array of contexts:

```json
[
  {
    "schema": "iglu:com.acme_company/product_context/jsonschema/1-0-0",
    "data": {
      "product_name": "product_name_value",
      "product_price": 10.0,
      "product_id": "product_id_value",
      "product_type": "product_type_value"
    }
  },
  {
    "schema": "iglu:com.acme_company/page_context/jsonschema/1-0-0",
    "data": {
      "page_name": "page_name_value",
      "page_path": "page_path_value",
      "page_category": "page_category_value"
    }
  }
]
```

The array of context is then sent with the event where event call to Snowplow that looks like this:

```javascript
Snowplow.logEvent(
  {
    schema: 'iglu:com.acme_company/event_action/jsonschema/2-0-0',
    data: {
      avo_event_name: 'CART_UPDATED',
      event_property_1: 'event_property_value_1',
      event_property_2: 'event_property_value_2',
    },
  },
  [
    {
      schema: 'iglu:com.acme_company/product_context/jsonschema/1-0-0',
      data: {
        product_name: 'product_name_value',
        product_price: 10.0,
        product_id: 'product_id_value',
        product_type: 'product_type_value',
      },
    },
    {
      schema: 'iglu:com.acme_company/page_context/jsonschema/1-0-0',
      data: {
        page_name: 'page_name_value',
        page_path: 'page_path_value',
        page_category: 'page_category_value',
      },
    },
  ],
);
```

The Snowplow object above is provided by you, so you get full access to this payload and can easily route it to Snowplow.
