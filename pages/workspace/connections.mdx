The connection tab is where you configure your **sources** (programming languages and development platforms) and **destinations** (analytics platforms).

## <a name="sources"></a> Sources: Where the data comes from

Sources represent where you send your data from. These can be mobile apps,
websites, backends, etc. Each source has an identifiable name, a development
platform, programming language and <Link passHref href="/concepts/destinations"><a>Destinations</a></Link> to send to.

Avo uses these Sources to generate code based on your event schema.

Avo currently supports these development platforms and programming languages:

### <a name="web"></a> Web

- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- ReasonML

### <a name="mobile"></a> Mobile

- React Native

### <a name="desktop"></a> Desktop

## <a name="destinations"></a> Destinations: Where the data gets published to

Destinations represent where your data should be sent. Your analytics platform
of choice. Destinations have an identifiable name, analytics platform,
development API key and production API key.

We recommend using separate projects for development and production to make sure
you don’t taint your production data while working on your product.

Below are short description of each supported tool, with instructions on how to

### <a name="custom"></a> Custom Destination

Sometimes the best way to integrate Avo is through a custom destination. For example for teams that:

- have a custom pipline
- are sending data to analytics platforms through an API (not using their SDK)

It's also sometimes possible to use a custom destination for language - analytics pairs that are not supported by Avo yet. Please <Link passHref href="/help/troubleshooting"><a>contact us</a></Link> if you are unsure of what is the best solution for you.

Detailed instructions on how to set up a custom destination can be found in our <Link passHref href="/implementation/start-custom-destination"><a>custom destination docs</a></Link>.
