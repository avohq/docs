# Share implementation instructions

_Share auto-generated implementation instructions with your team in your favourite task management tool_

<Callout>
  This feature has been deprecated with the new [branch implementation
  instructions](/workspace/code-changes) that include more details, better
  filtering, visual diffing and more.
</Callout>

While the branch review screen is handy for understanding the changes done in the tracking plan, itâ€™s not very convenient for implementation.
For implementation we divide the changes per source and then group them by events, so developers can pick their platform and implement events once by one.

If your branch includes changes on at least one source then the implementation instructions will be available on the diff screen

You can copy the instruction and pass them to developers for implementation in your communication tool of choice in either Markdown or in [Jira's text format](https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/WikiRendererHelpAction.jspa?section=all).
