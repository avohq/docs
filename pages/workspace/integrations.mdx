### Jira

When you make changes to your tracking plan on an Avo branch, Avo automatically generates [implementation instructions](/implementation/read-implementation-diff) that details all changes in your tracking plan branch, with deeplinks directly to the respective event and property in Avo. When your tracking plan branch is ready for review or implementation, with the push of a button you can copy/paste the instructions directly into a Jira ticket.

**Coming Soon:** When a tracking plan branch is ready for review, Avo will automatically create a Jira ticket for the reviewer. When a tracking plan branch is ready for implementation, Avo will automatically create Jira tickets with instrumentation instructions.

### GitHub

**Coming Soon:** When a tracking plan branch is ready to implement Avo will auto create a pull request for your development team that includes the latest analytics changes.
