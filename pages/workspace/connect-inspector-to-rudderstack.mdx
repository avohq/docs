## Use Avo Inspector as a RudderStack destination

If you are already sending your data to RudderStack you can stream it to Avo Inspector without adding any code to your codebase.

You'll need to create a RudderStack Destination powered by RudderStack Transformation with a code snippet provided in your Avo workspace for each app and environment combination.

> The Transformations that we will add here are not changing the events you receive from RudderStack in any way.
> They add a side effect of the Avo Inspector analyzing your events and keeping your RudderStack events stream unchanged.

In RudderStack you usually have different sources for each app environment, for example if you have a single web app, you probably have Web App Dev and Web App Production sources in RudderStack.

Unlike RudderStack, Avo sources contain environments in them, so you will only need to create one Avo source per app, in our example you'll need a single Avo source called Web App.

After connecting a Transformation to corresponding RudderStack source the event schemas of all events seen in RudderStack will automatically be sent to Avo Inspector and you'll be able to monitor the quality of your tracking implementation without any changes in your code!

> Remember that production data takes up to 2 hours to appear in the Inspector dashboard, while development data is available without any delay

## Guide to connect RudderStack and Avo Inspector

### Create an Avo source to get the code snippets for your RudderStack integration

#### Step 1. Set up your Avo source

An Avo Source is the first thing you need to connect your RudderStack data to Avo Inspector.

Open `Sources` in the Avo sidebar or `Manage Sources` in the Inspector tab

<center style={{ marginBottom: 16 + 'px' }}>
  <img
    width="100%"
    src={require('../../images/workspace/nav-inspector-sources-highlighted.png')}
    alt="Navigation to the Inspector sources screen in Avo"
  />
</center>

If you already have the source, pick it. If you don’t have the source corresponding to your app, <Link passHref href="/workspace/inspector#configuring-sources"><a>add a new one</a></Link>.

<center style={{ marginBottom: 16 + 'px' }}>
  <img
    src={require('../../images/add-source.png')}
    alt="Image of the Add Source button in Avo"
  />
</center>

In the source details, go to "Inspector Setup" and there you’ll see options to integrate Inspector. Pick RudderStack to see the integration code snippets.

<center style={{ marginBottom: 16 + 'px' }}>
  <img
    height="400"
    src={require('../../images/guide-rudder-to-inspector/source-setup.png')}
    alt="Source settings in Avo"
  />
</center>

Use the copy button to copy the full snippet to clipboard when you need to paste them into RudderStack on the next step.

<center style={{ marginBottom: 16 + 'px' }}>
  <img
    src={require('../../images/guide-segment-to-inspector/code-snippets.png')}
    alt="Development and production code snippets to integrate with Inspector"
  />
</center>

#### Step 2. Create RudderStack transformation with the provided code snippets

- Open RudderStack and log in into your workspace

- Pick `Transformations` in the sidebar

- Press the `New Transformation` button in the top right corner

<center style={{ marginBottom: 16 + 'px' }}>
  <img
    src={require('../../images/guide-rudder-to-inspector/rudder-transformations-menu.png')}
    alt="RudderStack navigation to the transformations menu"
  />
</center>

You’ll find yourself in the web code editor provided by RudderStack.
Here you would paste one of the code snippets we’ve seen in Avo on the 1st step.

> You'll need to create a separate Transformation for each code snippet, i.e. one for development, one for staging and one for production per each Avo source.

Save it by pressing `Save` button under the code editor.

<center style={{ marginBottom: 16 + 'px' }}>
  <img
    src={require('../../images/guide-rudder-to-inspector/create-transformation.png')}
    alt="RudderStack create transformation"
  />
</center>

#### Step 3. Test your development RudderStack Transformation (Optional)

> You can test the production RudderStack Transformation in the same way, but keep in mind that the production data shows with a ~2 hours delay in the Inspector dashboard, while development data is shown without delay

If you pick the Track event in the Events code editor in the bottom of the page and then press "Run Test" button, the event will be sent to Avo Inspector

To see the event in Avo you will need to fix the event `originalTimestamp` to a recent timestamp.

For example change this old timestamp provided by RudderStack (line highlighted on the screenshot below)

```
"originalTimestamp": "2020-05-25T18:37:10.917Z",

```

to current ISO timestamp, which you can find [on this website](https://greenwichmeantime.com/articles/clocks/iso/)

Press the `Run Test` button.

Check out the `Logs`, it should say `Log: {"ok":true}` in the end.

<center style={{ marginBottom: 16 + 'px' }}>
  <img
    height="500"
    src={require('../../images/guide-rudder-to-inspector/rudderstack-transformation-test.png')}
    alt="Test run results in RudderStack"
  />
</center>

Then navigate to Avo, pick `Inspector` in the sidebar and pick Development environment

<center style={{ marginBottom: 16 + 'px' }}>
  <img
    src={require('../../images/guide-segment-to-inspector/inspector-development-env.png')}
    alt="Environment picker in Inspector"
  />
</center>

You’ll see the event in your dashboard under the source from where you got the snippet from.

<center style={{ marginBottom: 16 + 'px' }}>
  <img
    height="500"
    src={require('../../images/guide-segment-to-inspector/source-in-inspector.png')}
    alt="Source overview in Inspector"
  />
</center>

This means that the RudderStack Transformation is working.

#### Step 4. Connect the RudderStack Transformation to your RudderStack Destinations

To properly route the data to Avo Inspector you'll need to create a destination per each app environment and then connect corresponding Inspector Transformation to the destination.

> For example, you are have a web app with production and development environments and send the data to Mixpanel.
>
> In this case you'll need to create two Mixpanel destinations in RudderStack - one for the production app and another one for the development app. Mixpanel settings will be identical in both.
>
> Connect the Transformation created with the development Inspector snippet to the development Mixpanel destination and the production Inspector Transformation to the production Mixpanel destination.

To make the connection pick `Destinations` in the sidebar, pick one destination and go to `Transformations` tab.

There you can pick a Transformation that will be ran on every event that is sent to this destination.

On this screenshot we connected the development Avo Inspector transformation to the Development Destination.

<center style={{ marginBottom: 16 + 'px' }}>
  <img
    src={require('../../images/guide-rudder-to-inspector/rudder-destinations-menu.png')}
    alt="RudderStack navigation to the transformations menu"
  />
</center>

Then go to the `Sources` tab and make sure that the destination is connected to the correct source.

<center style={{ marginBottom: 16 + 'px' }}>
  <img
    src={require('../../images/guide-rudder-to-inspector/rudder-destination-sources.png')}
    alt="Connecting a source for the destination in RudderStack"
  />
</center>

Now your RudderStack events stream from this source to this destination is analyzed by the Avo Inspector.
