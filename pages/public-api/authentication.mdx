Avo API uses `Basic authentication` to authenticate requests with Avo service accounts.

## Authenticating with Avo API

Avo API accepts service account token as an authentication method.

Authenticate with the API:

1. Create Service Account

   Start by <Link passHref href="/public-api/authentication#creating-service-accounts"><a>creating a Service Account</a></Link> and store the secret somewhere secure.

2. Authorization Header

   The Avo API expects the authorization header to be set with BASIC auth.

   - Base64 encoded `name:secret` from the service account.

   ```json
   ("authorization": "Basic <Base64 encoded token>")
   ```

3. Send a request with the header

   ```sh
   curl -H "authorization: Basic <Base64 encoded token>" -X GET https://api.avo.app/workspaces/<WorkspaceId>/branches/<BranchId>/export/v1
   ```

   > You can find the `<WorkspaceId>` and `<BranchId>` in the URL of your Avo workspace: `https://www.avo.app/schemas/<WorkspaceId>/branches/<BranchId>/`

## Creating Service Accounts

1. Navigate to your [Service Account Workspace Settings](https://www.avo.app/schemas/default?settings=service-accounts) or open the settings cogwheel in the Avo sidebar, select `Workspace Settings` and then open the `Service Accounts` tab.

   > If you don't see the Service Account tab you might not have access yet. Reach out to us.

   </center>

2. Enter a descriptive name for where you'll be using this service account and press the `Generate Secret` button.

   > Only workspace members with Admin access can create service accounts.

3. Once Avo has generated and securely stored your secret, you get one chance to view it. Copy the secret key and save it securely in your internal systems.

   > Avo postfixes the name with `_sa_[randomId]` so make sure to copy the final name

   </center>

   > You will never see the secret key again, so make sure to copy it.

## Deleting a Service Account

If for some reason you need to delete your service account, you can do so from the service account management page.

1. Navigate to your <Link passHref href="https://www.avo.app/schemas/default?settings=service-accounts"><a>Service Account Workspace Settings</a></Link> or open the settings cogwheel in the Avo sidebar, select `Workspace Settings` and then open the `Service Accounts` tab.

2. Press the context menu to the right of the service account you want to remove and select `Delete Service Account`.

3. Press `Delete` again in the confirm window that pops up.

   > This action cannot be undone. Once deleted, there is no way to recover the service account again. As soon as a service account has been deleted it will stop working immediately.
