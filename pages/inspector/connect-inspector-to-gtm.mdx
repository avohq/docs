# Send data from Google Tag Manager to Avo Inspector

## Use Avo Inspector as a GTM tag

You can use a server side GTM to analyze your tracking with Avo Inspector.

We provide a tag template to import, which you can use to create a tag and connect it to your GTM clients.

> Avo Inspector operates on the environment level, please keep it in mind and create separate tags for development, staging and production data.

5. Choose which environment this tag is reporting from. Inspector distinguish development, staging, and production environments. Production is designed for high data volumes, while development and staging are designed for faster time to feedback in the Inspector dashboard. You'll see your dev and staging events in the Inspector dashboard almost instantly, while the production events can take up to an hour to appear
6. Add a trigger, it's best to analyse all events in Inspector. We suggest to add a trigger that accepts all events, for example with the `.*` regex. Make sure that you are only sending the events from the environment configured on the step 3. Learn more about defining triggers [here](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/topic/7679384)
7. Now all the data sent to this server side GTM will be analysed by Inspector. Learn more about sending data to the server side Tag Manager [here](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/server-side/send-data)
