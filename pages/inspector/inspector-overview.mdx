# Inspector Overview

_How to set up and use the Inspector in Avo_

The first step to better analytics governance is knowing what's wrong with your data today.

We built Inspector to help you understand how your current tracking is performing. Inspector both identifies [common issues in your existing tracking](/explore-tracking-plan/issue-types-in-inspector), such as inconsistent properties and types, and provides implementation status in the Avo Tracking Plan, so you always know the state of your tracking implementation in your app.

In this section of the Inspector docs we'll be covering how to configure and use Inspector in your workspace. You can learn about [how to install Inspector SDKs in your sources here](/implementation/avo-inspector-sdk-reference).
