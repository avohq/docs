# Fixing Inspector issues

## Fixing an issue found in Inspector

When you find an issue in Inspector, the problem can due to either tracking implementation or the tracking plan.

### Fixing an implementation issue found in Inspector

If the implementation is incorrect according to the tracking plan, we recommend the following steps:

- Copy the issue link 
- Create a task or ticket in your task management system and append the issue link and relevant details
- Assign the task or ticket to the relevant individual and/or team to investigate and fix the issue in the corresponding code

### Fixing a tracking plan issue found in Inspector

If the tracking plan is not representing the event correctly (and the implementation is correct), we recommend the following steps:

- If the event and/or property is not present in the Tracking Plan, add them directly from the Issue details view.
- If the event and/or property is already present in the Tracking Plan, navigate to the event and/or property from the Issue details view and update it accordingly. 

Once the necessary updates are made in the Tracking Plan, update the issue status to _Resolved_. If the issue reappears, it will be marked as a regression.
