# Inspector Issues View

_How to use the Inspector Issues view_

The Inspector issues view displays information about anomalies and discrepancies seen in your production data for the past 24 hours. This view allows you to sort and filter issues to uncover those relevant to you and gives you the overview and information needed to prioritize which of them to act on.

![Image shows an example default view of the Inspector issues view.](/images/inspector/inspector-issues-default.png)

Each issue in the table represents an issue on a particular event, or a particular property contained within an event. In the table you will see:

- Regression: If you've marked an issue as resolved and it has reappeared, it will be marked as a regression
- The issue type – for example, unexpected event or inconsistent property types; you can see the [(full list of issue types in Inspector here)](/explore-tracking-plan/issue-types-in-inspector)
- The name of the event and/or property impacted
- The source impacted; each impacted source will be flagged individually
- Issue timing – when it was first and last seen
- First seen – when the issue was first seen
- Last seen – when the issue was seen most recently
- Event volume – how many total instances of the event were seen
- Issue volume – how many instances of the event were seen with this issue
- Impacted releases – which release versions were impacted by the issue, sorted by the most recent release first
- Issue percentage – the proportion of events seen with this issue in relation to total event volume (issue volume / event volume)

## Sorting and filtering

The issue table can be sorted by any column. Sort by event volume, issue volume or issue percentage to quickly uncover which issues have the most impact on your data and prioritize accordingly.

To narrow down your search to your most relevant issues, you can filter by the following:

- **Issue Type**: The [Inspector Issue Type](/inspector/issue-types-in-inspector)
- **Source**: The source where the issue was seen
- **Event**: The event impacted by the issue
- **Property**: The property impacted by the issue
- **Category**: The category of the event impacted by the issue
- **Tag**: The tag of the event impacted by the issue
- **Release**: The product release version impacted by the issue. Currently there are three release filters available:
  - **Latest release**: The latest product release version seen on each of your sources
  - **Two latest releases**: The two latest product release versions seen on each of your sources. This option can be helpful if the latest release is not yet fully rolled out.
  - **Three latest releases**: The three latest product release versions seen on each of your sources. This option can be helpful if the two latest release are not yet fully rolled out.

In addition, you can view issues that have been marked as resolved or ignored. The unresolved and ignored views show you info from the past 24 hours but the resolved view contains every issue you have ever marked as resolved and has not regressed.

## Issue details

Click any issue in the list to see more details. If you have multiple sources connected with Inspector, you can dig into which sources are impacted by the issue and uncover which sources are most severely affected.

### Issue status

Set the status of an issue to communicate its current status to your team. The status can be set to one of the following:

- Unresolved: The default status for new issues. This status indicates that the issue has not been investigated.
- Ignore: If you know you're not planning to fix an issue, you can set the status to ignore. This help you focus on those issues on which you want to act.
- Resolved: If you have looked into the issue and fixed it, you can set the status to resolved. If the issue reappears, it will be marked as a regression. If you have alerts enabled for a saved view with a resolved issue, you will be notified when the issue reappears.

### Event info

The event impacted by the issue, its volume and whether it is documented in your Avo tracking plan.

- If the event is not present in the tracking plan, click "Add to Tracking Plan" to instantly add it to your Tracking Plan.
- If the event is present in the tracking plan, click on the corresponding link to review and/or update its definition and details.

### Property info

The property impacted by the issue, and whether it is documented to be sent with the event in your tracking plan.

- If the property is present on the event in your tracking plan, click on the corresponding link to review and/or update its definition and details.

<Callout type="info">
  Not all issues are related to properties. See [the full list of issue types
  here](/explore-tracking-plan/issue-types-in-inspector).
</Callout>

### Releases

In this section you can see each release impacted by the issue in the last 24 hours (sorted by the most recent release first) with the following:

- The release version; hover over the clock icon to see the release date for that particular release
- The event volume seen on that release in the past 24 hours
- The issue volume seen on that release in the past 24 hours
- The issue percentage seen on that release in the past 24 hours

### Issue across sources

At the bottom of your issue details, you will see a list of all sources impacted by the issue. For each source you will see:

- Event volume
- Issue volume 
- Issue percentage 
- A link to the issue details on each additional impacted source.

![An example iOS issue that also impacts Android](/images/inspector/inspector-issue-details-sources.png)

### Activity log and comments

The activity log lives at the bottom of your issue details. The activity log includes the issue creation date and a breakdown of when someone changed the issue’s status or a regression happened. The Activity Log is a bit like commits in Github, where you can see time stamped changes and the team member who made the change. The activity log also includes your comments on that issue. With comments, you can communicate on a specific issue and tag your team members to weigh in on an issue you need to fix together.

## Release and source breakdown

By clicking the "X releases on Y sources" button right above the issues table, you can see a breakdown of the releases seen in the past 24 hours and used to calculate the issues you're looking at.

!["X releases on Y sources" button"](/images/inspector/inspector-issues-release-breakdown.png)

This breakdown can be helpful to understand which releases have been fully rolled out and which releases are still being rolled out. There may still be more issues to come for releases that are mid-rollout.

!["X releases on Y sources" button"](/images/inspector/inspector-issues-release-breakdown-modal.png)

In the example above, Inspector has seen a very low volume of events from the latest release on iOS (2.3.0) compared to prior releases. This is a strong indication that the latest release has not been fully rolled out.

## Fixing an issue found in Inspector

When you find an issue in Inspector, the problem can due to either tracking implementation or the tracking plan.

### Fixing an implementation issue found in Inspector

If the implementation is incorrect according to the tracking plan, we recommend the following steps:

- Copy the issue link 
- Create a task or ticket in your task management system and append the issue link and relevant details
- Assign the task or ticket to the relevant individual and/or team to investigate and fix the issue in the corresponding code

### Fixing a tracking plan issue found in Inspector

If the tracking plan is not representing the event correctly (and the implementation is correct), we recommend the following steps:

- If the event and/or property is not present in the Tracking Plan, add them directly from the Issue details view.
- If the event and/or property is already present in the Tracking Plan, navigate to the event and/or property from the Issue details view and update it accordingly. 

Once the necessary updates are made in the Tracking Plan, update the issue status to _Resolved_. If the issue reappears, it will be marked as a regression.

## Saving a filtered Issues view

Once you have filtered and/or sorted your issues, you can save the filtered view for quick access for you and your team. The saved view persists for both the filters and the sort order you have selected.

### Creating a saved view

When the issues view is opened, the default view is an unfiltered "All Issues" view ordered by Last Seen, such that the latest issues are on top. The "Save View" button is disabled until at least one filter or a sort order are applied.

![Image shows the default all issues view ordered by issues last seen.](/images/inspector/all-events-unfiltered-unsorted.png)

Once a filter is added or the sort order is changed, the "Save View" button is enabled. Click it to name the view and save it.

![Image shows a filtered view with it's naming and saving modal open.](/images/inspector/naming-and-saving-a-view.png)

Once the "Save filtered view" button is clicked, the view is successfully saved and it is displayed with its new name.

![Image shows a newly saved view.](/images/inspector/newly-saved-view.png)

In each saved view, there are buttons to copy the URL to the view and duplicate the view. The "Save View" button is disabled until further changes are made.

### Duplicating and modifying a saved view

To create a new view based on another saved view, you can:

- Click the Duplicate button to first duplicate it and then modify it 
- Modify an existing saved view and then click the "Save View as..." button to save it as a new view.

#### Duplicate and modify

To duplicate an existing saved view, click the Duplicate button in the top right corner, next to the "Save View" button.

![Image shows a saved view saved view with the duplicate button highlighted.](/images/inspector/duplicate-saved-view.png)

Then input a name for the new duplicated view and click "Duplicate filtered view".

![Image shows a saved view saved view with the name and save a duplicated view modal open and highlight.](/images/inspector/naming-and-saving-a-duplicated-view.png)

Once the "Duplicate filtered view" button is clicked, the duplicated view is successfully saved and displayed with the inputted name.

![Image shows a saved view saved view with the name and save a duplicated view modal open and highlight.](/images/inspector/newly-saved-duplicated-view.png)

From here, modify the duplicated view by changing the filters or sort order and save the changes by clicking the "Save View" button.

![Image shows a saved view saved view with the name and save a duplicated view modal open and highlight.](/images/inspector/modified-duplicated-view.png)

#### Modify and Save as

To modify an existing saved view, adjust the filtering or sort order to your current needs. 

- Changes won't be saved until you click the save button. 
- Editors can only save changes to their own views.

When a saved view has been modified, the following options are present:

- Save View: save changes to the now-modified view (available only if you are the creator of the saved view or a Workspace Admin)
- Save as: save a copy of the now-modified view under a new name (available to all user)
- Reset saved view: reset all filters and sort order to latest saved state of the saved view

Below is an example of a saved view that has been modified but not saved with the changes.

![Image shows a modified saved view saved view with unsaved changes.](/images/inspector/modified-view-with-unsaved-changes.png)

To save the changes as a new saved view, click "Save as...", give it a new name and save the changes.

![Image shows a modified saved view saved view with the Save as... modal open and highlighted.](/images/inspector/modified-view-with-saved-changes.png)

### Sharing a saved view

To share a saved view with a colleague, click the link button to copy the URL of the saved view. The copy link to view button is on all views (including those that are not saved).

![Image shows a saved view with the copy link button highlighted.](/images/inspector/sharing-a-saved-view.png)

### Renaming a saved view

To rename a saved view, click the title of the saved view to open a modal to rename it and save the changes.

![Image shows a saved view with the copy link button highlighted.](/images/inspector/renaming-a-saved-view.png)

### Accessing existing saved views

To find and access saved views that you or other workspace members have created, click the "All saved views" button in the top right corner of any Inspector Issues view.

![Image shows a saved view with the copy link button highlighted.](/images/inspector/all-saved-views-button-highlighted.png)

There you will find an overview over all saved views with information about:

- How many issues you they contain 
- When the view was last modified
- Who last modified the view 

![Image shows a the Inspector Issues page with the All saved views button highlighted.](/images/inspector/saved-views-overview.png)

From here, the creator of each saved view and Workspace Admins can archive saved views by opening the three dot menu on the right and click the Archive View button.

![Image shows a saved view with the copy link button highlighted.](/images/inspector/archiving-a-saved-view.png)

## Troubleshooting

### Why are there no issues in my issues view?

There are several reasons that may cause no issues to appear in your issues view, whether it's for a specific source or overall.

#### Inspector not installed on source

The most obvious reason is that you have not yet installed Inspector at all, or on the source that you are looking for. [install Inspector](/data-design/start-using-inspector#how-to-send-metadata-to-the-inspector) on the source for which you'd like to see issues.

#### Inspector not installed on production

The issues view currently only displays issues from the past 24 hours in production. That means that if you don't have Inspector installed for production on any given source, you won't see any issues in the Issues view. [Install Inspector](/data-design/start-using-inspector#how-to-send-metadata-to-the-inspector) on production for the source for which you'd like to see issues.

#### No issues in production for the past 24 hours

The issues view currently only displays issues from the past 24 hours in production. That means that if you don't have any issues in the past 24 hours, then you won't see any issues. Yay!

## What's next?

Once you've created your first saved filter view in Inspector Issues, it's time to connect Inspector Alerts.
