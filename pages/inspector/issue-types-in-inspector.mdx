### Property sometimes missing

There are two cases of this issue type:

- When a property is required in the tracking plan but sometimes or always missing
- Property not found in tracking plan but sometimes missing

_**Example:** Property onboarding status is not sent with 30% of the App Opened event._

### Property type mismatch

Detects type changes of event properties across tracking calls.

There are two cases of this issue type:

- More than one property value type seen
- Property value type different from tracking plan

_**Example:** Inconsistent type of property onboarding status on event App Opened: int (84%), string (16%)._

### Unexpected event

Alert when an event that is not defined in the tracking plan is detected by Inspector

_**Example:** Event Signup Completedd not found in Tracking Plan._

### Unexpected property

Alert when an property that is not defined in the tracking plan is detected by Inspector

_**Example:** Property authenticationMethod not found in Tracking Plan._

### Event missing on some platforms (coming soon)

Detects events sent by one platform, but not sent by another. Can be a sign of missing tracking calls.

_**Example:** iOS sends App Opened event, but Android does not._

### Property missing on some platforms (coming soon)

Detects properties sent by one platform, but not sent by another.

_**Example:** iOS sends user id with the App Opened event, but Android does not._

### Event volume change significant between versions (coming soon)

Detects significant changes in event volume between app versions.

_**Example:** Volume of event App Opened drop by 25% between versions v1.3.2 and v1.3.3 on iOS_

### Event volume significantly different between platforms (coming soon)

Detects events sent way more frequently by one platform versus another adjusted for sessions number. Can be a sign of duplicated or missing tracking calls.

_**Example:** iOS is sending 10x more volume per session than Android of the App Opened event._

### Event name casing (coming soon)

Detects event names spelled in undesirable casing.

_**Example:** Event open_app is snake case, expected title case (Open App)._

### Property name casing (coming soon)

Detects property names spelled in undesirable casing.

_**Example:** The property onboarding_status on event App Opened is snake_case, expected camel case (onboardingStatus)._

### Global property type mismatch (coming soon)

Detects properties with identical names and different types across all registered event schemas.

_**Example:** Inconsistent type of property revenue on events Purchase Completed: int and Checkout Completed: string._

## Smart Issues (coming soon)

- [Similar property names within event](#event-similar-property-names)
- [Unexpected type based on property name](#property-expected-type-mismatch)
- [Global similar property names](#global-similar-property-names)
- [Missing property based on property bundle pattern](#missing-usual-property-in-similar-events)
  

### Similar event names

Detects similar event names, that can point to duplicate tracking.

_**Example:** Potentially multiple events describing the same user action: App Opened, App Open, open_app + 2 more events._

### Similar property names within event

Detects similar property names in a single event.

_**Example:** Potentially multiple versions of the same property: onboarding_status, onboardingStatus, and Onboarding State._

### Unexpected type based on property name

Detects when a property name that is often associated with a specific type has some other type.

_**Example:** Revenue property is string type (expected to be a number)._

### Global similar property names (low)

Detects similar property names across all registered event schemas.

_**Example:** Potentially multiple versions of the same property: onboarding_status, onboardingStatus, and Onboarding State._

### Missing property based on property bundle pattern

Detects missing property in a bundle of similarly looking properties.

_**Example:** Property onboarding_status is sent with 4 out of 5 events of the Onboarding events bundle._
