# Temporarily ignore Inspector issues

This doc contains everything you need to know about the new feature to ignore certain Inspector issues temporarily.

## Overview

When you merge an Avo branch with changes, sometimes you get Inspector issues and alerts from older release versions. This feature lets you ignore those alerts until your new changes go live.

Now you can ignore issues before merging your Avo branch. Under the "Merge branch" button on the branch review screen. This helps you stop unwanted issues and alerts from old release versions.

<div style={{ paddingTop: '1.5rem', margin: 'auto' }}>
  ![Image shows a panel below the branch merge button, highlighting there are
  changes on this branch that could cause irrelevant issues and alerts in
  Inspector](/images/inspector/inspector-branch-merge-ignore.png)
</div>

## How to Use

1. Press "Configure" at the bottom of your branch review
2. For each source, pick how you want to ignore:
   - Ignore until version
     - **Latest version on branch merge**: _Inspector will validate the changes introduced on this branch in the latest release version after merge_
     - **Next version on branch merge**: _Inspector will validate the changes introduced on this branch in the next release version after merge_
   - Ignore until time
     - **One hour after branch merge**: _Inspector will start validating the changes introduced on this branch 1 hour after merge_
     - **24 hours after branch merge**: _Inspector will start validating the changes introduced on this branch 24 hours after merge_
   - **Don't ignore** (this is the default)
