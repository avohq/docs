# Import tracking plan from Inspector

Inspector compares ingested events and properties against your Avo tracking plan and highlights anything that‚Äôs missing. You can use those insights to quickly bootstrap or refine your tracking plan directly from live data.

Importing from Inspector is a fast, convenient way to build your tracking plan in Avo based on what‚Äôs already being sent by your product. It‚Äôs especially useful if:

- You don't yet have a tracking plan, or your current plan is unreliable
- You prefer not to import from other sources (e.g., Mixpanel, Amplitude, spreadsheets)
- You want to curate what gets added and incrementally build a high‚Äëquality plan over time

</Callout>

## What can be imported

- Events: New events observed by Inspector that aren‚Äôt yet documented in your tracking plan
- Properties: Properties of all value types, including [object properties](/data-design/object-properties). 

## Where to import from and how

You can import from both the Events view and the Issues view in Inspector. You can either import all missing events, including their properties, or a single event or property at a time.

### Bulk importing events and their properties

Both the events and issues views support bulk importing events and their properties. There is a button in the header of each view that says "Add (X) events to tracking plan". Clicking this button will open a modal with a list of events or properties to import.

#### Events view

Here's the location of the button in the Events view:

<div style={{ maxWidth: 600, paddingTop: '1.5rem', margin: 'auto' }}>

</div>

#### Issues view

Here's the location of the button in the Issues view:

<div style={{paddingTop: '1.5rem', margin: 'auto' }}>
  ![Add events from Inspector issues image](/images/inspector/add-missing-events.png)
</div>

### Importing a single event or property

A single event or property can be imported from the Events view or the Issues view.

#### Events view

In the Events view, the red tracking plan icon marks events and properties seen in your product but not documented in Avo. Click the event or property to open the issue details and click the "Add" button to import the item to the tracking plan. 

<div style={{ maxWidth: 600, paddingTop: '1.5rem', margin: 'auto' }}>
  ![Add events from Inspector events image](/images/inspector/add-events-from-inspector-events.png)
</div>

#### Issues view

Open an ‚ÄúEvent unexpected by tracking plan‚Äù issue and click ‚ÄúAdd to Tracking Plan‚Äù to import that event (and its properties) directly. Likewise, for a ‚ÄúProperty unexpected by tracking plan‚Äù issue, click ‚ÄúAdd to Tracking Plan‚Äù to add the property to your tracking plan and attach it to relevant events/sources.

<div style={{ maxWidth: 600, paddingTop: '1.5rem', margin: 'auto' }}>
  ![Add single event from issue image](/images/inspector/add-single-event-from-issue.png)
</div>

## Reviewing your import

Clicking any of the import buttons opens a "Review import data" view with an overview of the unexpected events and the sources where they were seen. Expand each event to review observed properties.

From here you can:

- Choose which events to include
- Choose which sources to include per event
- Choose which properties to include per event (create new ones as needed)
- Create or map <a href="/data-design/object-properties">object properties</a> when nested structures are detected
- Adjust property types and configure required/optional presence per event and per source

</Callout>

</div>

### Resolving conflicts

Avo automatically resolves or surfaces conflicts so your tracking plan stays consistent:

- Property already exists with a different type: The existing property is reused; you‚Äôll be notified if Inspector observed a different value type
- Property observed with multiple types: Defaults to the most common observed type (e.g., 70% string vs. 30% integer ‚Üí string)

<Callout type="info" emoji="üí°">
  After import, Inspector will continue to flag any ongoing data issues so you can keep improving quality over time.
</Callout>

Avo may also ask you to review potential duplicates:

- Similar event in tracking plan
- Similar event in import
- Similar event seen by Inspector

### Completing the import

Even though you can import directly to the main branch, we always recommend creating a new branch for imports so changes can be peer reviewed.

Click ‚ÄúImport‚Äù to finish.
