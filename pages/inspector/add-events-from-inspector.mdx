# Import tracking plan from Inspector

Inspector compares ingested events and properties against your Avo tracking plan and highlights anything that’s missing. You can use those insights to quickly bootstrap or refine your tracking plan directly from live data.

Importing from Inspector is a fast, convenient way to build your tracking plan in Avo based on what’s already being sent by your product. It’s especially useful if:

- You don't yet have a tracking plan, or your current plan is unreliable
- You prefer not to import from other sources (e.g., Mixpanel, Amplitude, spreadsheets)
- You want to curate what gets added and incrementally build a high‑quality plan over time

</Callout>

## What can be imported

- Events: New events observed by Inspector that aren’t yet documented in your tracking plan
- Properties: Both simple (non‑nested) properties and nested payloads as <a href="/data-design/object-properties">object properties</a>

## Where to import from and how

You can import from two places in Inspector. Both support importing events and properties.

### From the Events view

In the Events view, the red tracking plan icon marks events and properties seen in your product but not documented in Avo. Click the event or property to open the issue details and click the "Add" button to import the item to the tracking plan.

</div>

### From the Issues view

#### Import all missing events

The Issues View surfaces all events that Inspector observes but have not been added to the tracking plan. To import and review those events, click “Add (X) events to tracking plan” to review them in bulk. As with the Events view, you can include both new events and their properties, defining types and mapping nested payloads to <a href="/data-design/object-properties">object properties</a> as part of the import.

<div style={{ maxWidth: 600, paddingTop: '1.5rem', margin: 'auto' }}>

</div>

#### Import from a single issue

Open an “Event unexpected by tracking plan” issue and click “Add to Tracking Plan” to import that event (and its properties) directly. Likewise, for a “Property unexpected by tracking plan” issue, click “Add to Tracking Plan” to add the property to your tracking plan and attach it to relevant events/sources.

<div style={{ maxWidth: 600, paddingTop: '1.5rem', margin: 'auto' }}>
  ![Add single event from issue image](/images/inspector/add-single-event-from-issue.png)
</div>

## Reviewing your import

Clicking any of the import buttons opens a "Review import data" view with an overview of the unexpected events and the sources where they were seen. Expand each event to review observed properties.

From here you can:

- Choose which events to include
- Choose which sources to include per event
- Choose which properties to include per event (create new ones as needed)
- Create or map <a href="/data-design/object-properties">object properties</a> when nested structures are detected
- Adjust property types and configure required/optional presence per event and per source

</div>

## Resolving conflicts

Avo automatically resolves or surfaces conflicts so your tracking plan stays consistent:

- Property already exists with a different type: The existing property is reused; you’ll be notified if Inspector observed a different value type
- Property observed with multiple types: Defaults to the most common observed type (e.g., 70% string vs. 30% integer → string)

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
  After import, Inspector will continue to flag any ongoing data issues so you can keep improving quality over time.
</Callout>

Avo may also ask you to review potential duplicates:

- Similar event in tracking plan
- Similar event in import
- Similar event seen by Inspector

## Completing the import

You can import directly to the main branch or create a new branch.

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
  Unless you are starting from scratch, we recommend creating a new branch for imports so changes can be reviewed.
</Callout>

Click “Import” to finish.
