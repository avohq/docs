# Import events from Inspector

Inspector compares ingested events and properties against the tracking plan and detects if any are missing. You can import missing events or properties to your tracking plan from both the [Issues](/inspector/inspector-issues-view) and [Events](/inspector/inspector-events-view) views. 

## Import events in bulk from Inspector Issues view


If Inspector has detected events unexpected by the tracking plan, there will be a "Add X new events" button at the upper right of the main Inspector Issues table in the [Issues View](/inspector/inspector-issues-view#event-info).
<div style={{ maxWidth: 600, paddingTop: '1.5rem' , margin: 'auto'}}>

</div>
If there are no events unexpected by the tracking plan, this button will be greyed out and read "No new events".

###Reviewing your import
Once you click the button, a "Review import data" screen will open. At the top you will see a summary of:

- The number of unexpected events and associated sources found by Inspector
- The number of conflict alerts for the unexpected events and properties, which indicate whether the events in review are similar to events already documented in the tracking plan

The list of unexpected events and associated sources then follows, with the ability to expand each event to view the associated properties for each event.
From here you can:

- Select which events you'd like to include in your import
- Select the sources you'd like to include for each event selected for import
- Select the properties you'd like to include for each event selected for import; properties that do not exist in the tracking plan will also be created if included
- Select the branch on which you'd like to perform the import; if you're on the main branch you can create a new branch for import here

Once you have made your desired selections, click the "Import to Tracking Plan" button to create a branch which adds all of the selected events and associated properties to your tracking plan.

## Add events and properties from Inspector Events view

You can add individual events and properties that are missing from your tracking plan from the [Events view](/inspector/inspector-events-view).

### Event not in Tracking Plan

If the Inspector detects an event that is not in your tracking plan, it will be highlighted with a red tracking plan icon next to the name, along with an "Add" button to add it to your tracking plan. The events view sidebar also has an inline option to add the event. Click either button to add the event and all associated properties to the tracking plan.

Before creating an event in the tracking plan, Inspector will first validate the event name against all existing tracking plan events to determine if the event may already be present with different casing.
If the event already exists with different casing, a dialog will pop up to to inform the user of the potential duplication and confirm or cancel the addition of the event.

In addition to creating the event in the tracking plan, adding an event from Inspector will also do the following:

- Add all sources for the event according to Inspector
- Add all associated existing properties from the tracking plan onto the event based on Inspector
- Create and add properties that are missing from the tracking plan but are on the event based on Inspector
  - If the property already exists in different casing, it will not be created
  - If the property has reported seeing two types (int, string for example) the more prevalent type in Inspector will be selected
  - Each property will be created with the presence "Always Sent"
  - All new properties created will be created as **Event properties**

### Property not in tracking plan

Clicking on the event name cell will expand it such that its detected and associated properties are shown. If a property is missing from the tracking plan for that particular event, it is highlighted with a red tracking plan icon next to the property name, along with an "Add" button to add it to your tracking plan. The sidebar in the events view also has an inline option to add the property to the tracking plan. Click either button to add the missing property to the tracking plan. 
There are two cases for adding property to the event in the tracking plan:

1. If property exists in the tracking plan but is not on the event, you can add the existing property to this event in the tracking plan.
2. If property does not exists on the tracking plan, you are can create the event in the tracking plan and add it immediately to this event.

Before creating a standalone property in the tracking plan, Inspector will first validate the property name against all existing tracking plan properties to determine if the property may already be present with different casing.
If the property already exists with different casing, a dialog will pop up to to inform the user of the potential duplication and confirm or cancel the addition of the property.

In addition to creating the property in the tracking plan, adding a Property directly from Inspector will also do the following:

- If the property has reported seeing 2 types (int, string for example) the more prevalent type in Inspector will be selected
- The property will be created with the presence "Always Sent"
- The property will be created as **Event property**
