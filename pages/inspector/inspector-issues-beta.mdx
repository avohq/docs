# Inspector Issues View beta

*Information and disclaimers for the Inspector issues view closed beta*

## What is new in this beta?

In this beta we're introducing a new infrastructure that generates the issues. In addition we've added alerts for saved views.

### New infrastructure

#### What to look out for in this beta

We've built a new infrastructure for generating issues, that allows for more flexibility and speed. We are still tweaking the issue generation and the issue details so in the beginning you might encounter:
- Issues with no issue event volume
- Edge cases where an issue is displayed that may not be an actual issue
-

### Alerts for saved views

We've added alerts for saved views that use the issues from the new infrastructure. Now you can save a view and connect alerts for a saved view.

#### What to look out for in this beta

Some disclaimers for the Alerts specifically?

#### Connecting alerts to a saved view

**Inside a specific saved view**

If you haven't already created a saved view, start by [filtering all issues](/inspector/inspector-issues-view#sorting-and-filtering) and [saving the view](/inspector/inspector-issues-view#saving-a-filtered-view).

Once you have a saved view, you click the "Set up Alerts" button to initialize the connection

That triggers a modal to be opened, where you can choose to connect to Slack or give us feedback on how you would like your alerts delivered.

Then you get the native Slack modal where you can select a Slack workspace and channel that you want to connect. Once you have made your selection, you can hit allow to finish setting up alerts.

Now we have completed setting up alerts for our "Onboarding events" saved view, as indicated in the screenshot below.

**In saved views overview**

For your existing saved views, you can connect alerts in the Saved Views overview accessible from the navigation on the left

#### Disconnecting alerts

Alerts can be disconnected both in the Saved Views overview and inside an individual saved view, by clicking the Slack connection button.

You'll get a modal for you to confirm disconnecting the alerts, and the button will be replaced with the "Set up Alerts" button.
