# Issues

The **Inspector** monitors the health of your current tracking, catching common issues such as missing events or properties, casing inconsistencies, property type mismatches, significant difference in volumes between platforms and many more. The Inspector gives you insights into the health trends of your tracking and email alerts on any regressions. Enabling you to start improving your tracking in a data-driven way.

Here are the issue types that the **Inspector** can detect. You can enable any subset of them in your project.

### Issue Types

- <a href="#event-property-type-inconsistency">Property type mismatch</a>
- <a href="#event-volume-change-between-versions">Event volume change significant between versions</a>
- <a href="#significant-volume-mismatch-between-platforms">Event volume significantly different between platforms</a>
- <a href="#event-name-casing">Event name casing (coming soon)</a>
- <a href="#property-name-casing">Property name casing (coming soon)</a>
- <a href="#global-property-type-inconsistency">Global property type mismatch (coming soon)</a>

#### <a name="event-is-not-present-on-some-platforms"></a>Event missing on some platforms

Detects events sent by one platform, but not sent by another. Can be a sign of missing tracking calls.

_**Example:** iOS sends App Opened event, but Android does not._

#### <a name="property-missing-on-some-platforms"></a>Property missing on some platforms

Detects properties sent by one platform, but not sent by another.

_**Example:** iOS sends user id with the App Opened event, but Android does not._

#### <a name="missing-usual-property-in-event"></a>Property sometimes missing

Detects absence of event properties across tracking calls.

_**Example:** Property onboarding status is not sent with 30% of the App Opened event._

#### <a name="event-property-type-inconsistency"></a>Property type mismatch

Detects type changes of event properties across tracking calls.

_**Example:** Inconsistent type of property onboarding status on event App Opened: int (84%), string (16%)._

#### <a name="event-volume-change-between-versions"></a>Event volume change significant between versions

Detects significant changes in event volume between app versions.

_**Example:** Volume of event App Opened drop by 25% between versions v1.3.2 and v1.3.3 on iOS_

#### <a name="significant-volume-mismatch-between-platforms"></a>Event volume significantly different between platforms

Detects events sent way more frequently by one platform versus another adjusted for sessions number. Can be a sign of duplicated or missing tracking calls.

_**Example:** iOS is sending 10x more volume per session than Android of the App Opened event._

#### <a name="event-name-casing"></a>Event name casing (coming soon)

Detects event names spelled in undesirable casing.

_**Example:** Event open_app is snake case, expected title case (Open App)._

#### <a name="property-name-casing"></a>Property name casing (coming soon)

Detects property names spelled in undesirable casing.

_**Example:** The property onboarding_status on event App Opened is snake_case, expected camel case (onboardingStatus)._

#### <a name="global-property-type-inconsistency"></a>Global property type mismatch (coming soon)

Detects properties with identical names and different types across all registered event schemas.

_**Example:** Inconsistent type of property revenue on events Purchase Completed: int and Checkout Completed: string._

### Smart Issues (coming soon)

- <a href="#similar-event-names">Similar event names</a>
- <a href="#event-similar-property-names">Similar property names within event</a>
- <a href="#property-expected-type-mismatch">Unexpected type based on property name</a>
- <a href="#global-similar-property-names">Global similar property names</a>
- <a href="#missing-usual-property-in-similar-events">Missing property based on property group pattern</a>

#### <a name="similar-event-names"></a>Similar event names

Detects similar event names, that can point to duplicate tracking.

_**Example:** Potentially multiple events describing the same user action: App Opened, App Open, open_app + 2 more events._

#### <a name="event-similar-property-names"></a>Similar property names within event

Detects similar property names in a single event.

_**Example:** Potentially multiple versions of the same property: onboarding_status, onboardingStatus, and Onboarding State._

#### <a name="property-expected-type-mismatch"></a>Unexpected type based on property name

Detects when a property name that is often associated with a specific type has some other type.

_**Example:** Revenue property is string type (expected to be a number)._

#### <a name="global-similar-property-names"></a>Global similar property names (low)

Detects similar property names across all registered event schemas.

_**Example:** Potentially multiple versions of the same property: onboarding_status, onboardingStatus, and Onboarding State._

#### <a name="missing-usual-property-in-similar-events"></a>Missing property based on property group pattern

Detects missing property in a group of similarly looking properties.

_**Example:** Property onboarding_status is sent with 4 out of 5 events of the Onboarding events group._
