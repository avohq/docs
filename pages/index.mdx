# Get Started With Avo

There are a few ways to get started in Avo, all depending on your immediate needs:
- [**Find (and fix) your data quality issues**](#get-an-overview-of-your-current-state-of-tracking-with-inspector): For teams that are struggling with data quality, install Inspector and get a view of all your data quality issues in one place
- [**Try the Avo workflow**](#try-the-avo-workflow-for-your-next-analytics-release): For teams that want a solid workflow for their next analytics release, create a branch in Avo and define new events and properties
- [**Audit your tracking plan**](#audit-your-tracking-plan): For teams that want a single source of truth for their tracking plan and review their event and property definitions, import your existing tracking plan into Avo or manually create one

You can do these steps in any order or in parallel, and skip those you
don’t think apply to you.

## Find (and fix) your data quality issues

The first step to better analytics governance is knowing what’s wrong with your data today. Avo Inspector gives you an overview of your current state of tracking
and highlights issues and discrepancies in your live event tracking. Avo then provides you with the tools to systematically get to better data, one resolved issue at a time. 

Install Inspector to get started. From install to live observability, Inspector is ready in under 89 seconds. Set up Inspector via your CDP and get to work on your data quality right away. 

No CDP? No problem. Install via GTM or via a custom SDK.

## Try the Avo workflow for your next analytics release

If you have an analytics release coming up in the next few days, we
highly recommend you try out the Avo Workflow for that release.

The Avo workflow covers all the steps required to plan, review,
request implementation, implement, validate and publish your analytics
release.

We recommend your first “full-circle” release in Avo be a small one,
for example a product release that includes a handful of new or
updated events. This will enable you to quickly go through your first
analytics release in Avo, from start to finish. You can do this with or without your tracking plan in Avo.

## Audit your tracking plan

Getting your tracking plan into Avo gives you an instant audit of your event structures. There are three ways to get your tracking plan into Avo:
- [Import from Amplitude, Mixpanel or Google Sheets](/publishing/importing)
- [Import events from Inspector](/inspector/add-events-from-inspector)
- [Build your tracking plan from scratch](/data-design/start-data-design)
