## Generated code

Avo implements different types of regression checking for your analytics. First
one is constantly validating your data during development in the code generated
analytics wrapper.

## CLI command

The second form of regression checking Avo provides is in the form of linting
via the `avo status` command.

The `avo status` command errors if no tracking call is found for any of the events on your current Avo Branch per Source. It can added to a your continuous integration to make sure you always "finish" implementing a specific source, and never remove an event implementation.

This is an early iteration of the `avo status` command and therefore it has a few caveats:

- It will only process Avo tracking calls (not any analytics calls)
- It will only error if the tracking call is not at all there. This means two things:
  1. It will not error if one tracking call instance is removed for a specific event, but there are still some tracking calls for this event remaining
  2. It will not error if the tracking call remains in the code but is commented out
