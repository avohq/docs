# What can I do with Avo?

### Can I use Avo to diagnose analytics issues?

Yes, you can! The [Avo Inspector SDK](/implementation/avo-inspector-sdk-reference) will automatically [monitor the health of your current tracking](/inspector/start-using-inspector) and suggest fixes for issues such as missing events or properties, casing inconsistencies, property type mismatches, significant difference in volumes between platforms and many more.

### Can I use Avo without adjusting my Privacy Policy?

Yes, you can! Avo does not collect any user data. We only collect metadata about your user data. Avo doesn’t need to know the actual values, we only need to understand the shape of the data.

### Can I use Avo to fix analytics issues?

Yes, you can! The [Avo Inspector SDK](/implementation/avo-inspector-sdk-reference)
will automatically [monitor the health of your current tracking](/inspector/start-using-inspector)
and suggest fixes for issues such as missing events or properties, casing inconsistencies, property type mismatches, significant difference in volumes between platforms and many more.

### Can I use Avo to generate analytics tracking code?

Yes, you can! We offer a few different ways to do this. You can pull the [
analytics wrappers from the CLI](/implementation/cli#step-3-pull-generated-analytics-wrappers-from-avo)
, or you can copy them from the Codegen tab within the Avo UI.

### Can I use Inspector on my dev environment? What about production?

Yes, you can! You can utilize Inspector in any environment. However, we suggest using Production data to surface issues accurately.

### Can I use Avo in production without crashing my app?

Yes, you can! Validation logs and warnings are by default only sent in the development environment, not in production. Strict mode validation can be enabled in development, which throws errors instead of logging them.

### Can I sort and organize my events and analytics in Avo?

Yes, you can! We recommend setting up and [utilizing Categories](/data-design/organizing-metrics-and-events)
and tags to keep track of events from different product features.

### Can I implement platform-specific events or metrics?

Yes, you can! Within the Avo UI, you will be able to select platform-specific sources and destinations if you are on the Team or Enterprise Plans. For more information about source availability, [
check out what we support here](/data-design/define-sources-and-destinations#sources-where-the-data-comes-from)
.

### Can I use Avo with my git workflow?

Yes you can! Every team works differently, but we’ve put together an [example workflow here](/implementation/avo-and-git)
. Our [CLI documentation](/implementation/cli#using-avo-branches)
has more information on specific commands.

### Can I use Avo to draft changes to my tracking plan in isolation?

Yes, you can! We have a branched workflow and encourage all users to never directly edit the main branch. Avo’s Branched Workflow lets multiple teams work on conflicting metrics changes without disrupting each other’s work.

### Can I use Avo to collaborate with my teammates?

Yes, you can, and we hope you do! Check out [this post](https://www.avo.app/blog/introducing-branch-collaborators).

### Can I document my metrics in context with my tracking plan?

Yes, you can! We recommend [defining metrics](/data-design/avo-tracking-plan/metrics)
before adding events to your tracking plan. In Avo, they are connected to events and help stakeholders understand why this event is being tracked.

### Can I reuse a definition of a property in Avo?

Yes you can! Avo’s property library is global in scope, so you don’t have to worry about multiple definitions for the same attribute.

### Can I define what property values are allowed in Avo?

Yes you can! [Property constraints](/data-design/defining-descriptive-events-and-properties#property-constraints)
within Avo allow you to create predefined rules about the values you will allow for any given property. Say goodbye to the days of nonsense metadata like “age” = “-1”.

### Can I use Avo in my unit tests?

Yes you can! [Avo in unit tests](/implementation/avo-and-unit-tests)
can be initialized with a noop flag that disables network requests and only run data validation.

### Can I add descriptions to my events and properties with Avo?

Yes you can! [Defining descriptive events and properties](/data-design/defining-descriptive-events-and-properties#descriptions-for-events-and-properties)
is a best practice for keeping all your current and future teammates on the same page.

Yes, you can! In Inspector, you will see issues when naming conventions have been violated. You will also receive [feedback in event and property naming modals](/data-design/defining-descriptive-events-and-properties#naming-conventions-for-events-and-properties)
and a summary in our [issue reporter](/audit/overview)
within your tracking plan.
