While the branch review screen is handy for understanding the changes done in the tracking plan, it’s not very convenient for implementation. For implementation we divide the changes per source and then group them by events, so developers can pick their platform and implement events one by one.

If your branch includes changes on at least one source then the implementation instructions will be available at the top of the branch review screen.

        alt="The Avo Workflow: Plan, review, implement, validate and publish your tracking changes"
  />
</center>

You can copy the instructions and pass them to developers for implementation in your collaboration tool of choice (e.g. Jira or Slack) in either Markdown or in Jira's text format.
