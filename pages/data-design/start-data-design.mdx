- The basic concepts in Avo and event design
- What to look out for when designing data

## Defining a metric

We always recommend starting with the why in data design. That means thinking about your research questions, goals and metrics before your start defining your event structures. Metrics are directly tied to events in Avo and are visible in the event details. Read more about metrics, why they are useful and learn about purpose meetings in our [Metrics page](/data-design/avo-tracking-plan/metrics).

### Step 1 – Open a branch in Avo

If you are making changes to your tracking plan in Avo, we always recommend creating a branch first – no matter how small your change might be. That allows you to make suggestions in isolation from the source of truth on your main branch and get feedback from your peers.

Open a new branch by clicking the icon "main" in the left sidebar. Then you are prompted to open an existing branch or creating a new one.

Now you should see the name of your branch instead of "main".

### Step 2 – Navigate to the metrics view

Navigate to the metrics screen by clicking "Metrics" in the "Tracking Plan" section of the left sidebar.

### Step 3 – Create a new metric

Create a [metric](/data-design/avo-tracking-plan/metrics) by clicking the "+ Add Metric" button in the top left corner. Give it a name and a description to elaborate on what the metric means.

### Step 4 – Add your metric to a category

We recommend [organizing your metrics and events](/data-design/organizing-metrics-and-events) by using categories. Add your [metric](/data-design/avo-tracking-plan/metrics) to a category by clicking "+ Add to Category" below the description input. If a relevant category doesn't already exist you can create it there and add the metric to it.

  alt="Add metric to category"
/>

_Example: Adding metric to a category._

### Step 5 – Select metric type

The metric type determines how you will construct your metric in your analytics platform or raw database. The available metrics types in Avo are _Funnel_, _Segmentation_, _Retention_ and _Proportion_. Read about their unique capabilities in our [Metrics page](/data-design/avo-tracking-plan/metrics).

  alt="Selecting metric type"
/>

_Example: Selecting a metric type._

### Step 6 – Add events

The final step of configuring your metric is to add existing or new events to your metric. This will make the metric visible in the event details of the events added, and help whoever wants to dig into your data to know exactly how this metric is defined and how they can structure it in your analytics platform.

#### Adding existing events to a metric

To add your existing events to a metric, you can simply click "Add Event..." and search the event library for the event that you are looking for. For all metrics you can filter on a specific property value to build your metric, and for segmentation you can select a property to group by.

_Example: Adding an existing event to a metric._

#### Adding new events to a metric

If the user action that you want represented in your metric is not already defined as an event, you can create one from the metrics view.

In the metrics details, click "Add Event..." and start typing the name of the event you want to create. If Avo doesn't find an event with a matching name, you will be offered to create one. The name of your new event will be autimatically audited by Avo (see [Audit rules and configurations](/audit/rules)). Once you have created your event you can add more to the metric, or click it to configure it (see [Configuring your event](/data-design/start-data-design#step-4-configure-your-event) below).

## Defining and configuring events

[Events](/data-design/avo-tracking-plan/events) are the core of event based product analytics. They are sent to your analytics platform when a user performs actions in your product. The technical structure of an event is in form of an event name and properties that describe the user action further. In addition, Avo allows you to describe events with descriptions, screenshots, variants and more. See step by step definition and configuration of an example event below.

### Step 1 – Open a branch in Avo

If you are making changes to your tracking plan in Avo, we always recommend creating a branch first – no matter how small your change might be. That allows you to make suggestions in isolation from the source of truth on your main branch and get feedback from your peers.

Open a new branch by clicking the icon "main" in the left sidebar. Then you are prompted to open an existing branch or creating a new one.

### Step 2 – Navigate to the events view

If you are not in the Events view already, click "Events" under tracking plan in the sidebar on the left.

_Example: Navigating to events._

### Step 3 – Create a new event

Create a new event by clicking the "+ Add Event" button in the top left corner. Give it a name and try to follow the naming convention in your tracking plan. Avo will automatically audit the name (see [Audit rules and configurations](/audit/rules)) and help you follow the casing used in your workspace.

  alt="Creating a new event"

_Example: Creating a new event._

### Step 4 – Configure your event

#### Add a description

We always recommend adding a descriptive description to every event, that describes when the event should be sent. That will help prevent discrepancies between products, platforms and code paths. Read more in our
[defining descriptive events and properties guide](/data-design/defining-descriptive-events-and-properties).

#### Add a source (required)

Add a
[source](/data-design/define-sources-and-destinations) to your event to define where it should be sent from and in which programming language the implemented in. If you have an established workspace you probably have the sources you need already set up and can select them from the drop down that appears when you click "+ Add Source". If not, you might need to set up and configure your sources and destinations in the
[Sources view](/data-design/define-sources-and-destinations).

/>

_Example: Adding a description and sources to an event._

#### Add actions and properties

All events in Avo have the
["Log Event" action](/data-design/avo-tracking-plan/events#log-event) by default, which means that a user action is logged as an event to the analytics platform. This is the most common use case and the one that we are focusing on in this guide. With the "Log Event" action you can add [event properties](data-design/avo-tracking-plan/properties#event-properties), which allows you to attach detailed information about the action the user performed. See how to [create and configure event properties](/data-design/start-data-design#defining-and-configuring-event-properties) in the section below.

#### Add variants

#### Add event triggers (screenshots)

#### Add a category

We recommend
[organizing your metrics and events](/data-design/organizing-metrics-and-events) by using categories. Add your event to a category by clicking "+ Add to Category" below the Actions section in the event. If a relevant category doesn't already exist you can create it there and add the event to it.

#### Add a tag

Tags can be used to organize and your events further than with categories. For example if you have a product in multiple countries, you might want to tag each event with which countries are relevant for it.

## Defining and configuring event properties

In this guide we're focusing on
[event properties](/data-design/avo-tracking-plan/properties#event-properties) on events with the Log Event action, as that is the most common use case for beginners. There are a few more
[actions](/data-design/avo-tracking-plan/events#actions) available as well as two other kinds of properties (
[user properties](/data-design/avo-tracking-plan/properties#properties) and
[system properties](/data-design/avo-tracking-plan/properties#system-properties)).

### Step 1 – Create a new event property

To create a new event property and add it to an event, first open the event you want to add it to. Then click "+ Add Event Property" under the "Log Event" section of the actions and type the name of the property that you want to create. Then click "Create New Property" and review and confirm the name of the property in the naming editor that pops up. As with event names, the naming assistant will help you follow the casing in your workspace and prevent duplicate property names. Now you have created a new event property and added it to your event.

  alt="Creating a new event property for an event"
/>

_Example: Creating a new event property for an event._

### Step 2 – Configure a property

#### Add a description

As with event, we highly recommend adding descriptions to all properties. That helps the ones that implement to know exactly what variable in their code they should assign to that property.

#### Select the data type

Change the data type of your property to match the one you need by clicking on where it says "String" below the description input. Then you will be able to pick from the following types:

- string: only all string values are allowed
- int: only whole number values are allowed
- float: only floating point values are allowed
- boolean: only `true` or `false` values are allowed
- [object](/data-design/object-properties): only dictionary or nested object structures are allowed, learn more about objects in Avo
  [here](/data-design/object-properties)
- any (available upon request): any data type is allowed and not type validation will occur

#### Decide if it's optional or required

All properties are required by default and we recommend trying to keep them required in as many cases a possible. That means that the Avo developer tools will throw and error if the property is not assigned a value in development, which reduces the risk of missing data significantly. You can however set a property to be optional by checking the "Optional" check box beside the data type, if it's not always relevant to send a value for that property.

#### Add rules

Properties don't have any rules by default, but we recommend setting rules that match the limitation of the possible values for every property.

- String rules: you can pick exactly which string values are allowed for your property. We recommend doing so for all string properties that have a limited number of allowed values.
- Int and Float rules: Numerical properties can have rules that limit the value to a range between a minimum and maximum value. We recommend to set a min and max where relevant, for example to prevent negative values for count properties.

### Step 3 – Add existing event property to an event

We always recommend everyone that design data to first look into the existing events and properties to see if there are any that are relevant for your use case.

To add an existing event property to your event, click "+ Add Event Property" under in the "Log Event" section of the actions and start typing the name of the property to search for it in the property library. If you don't know the name of your property, you can also scroll down to find it. Once you have found your property, click it's name and it's added to your event.
