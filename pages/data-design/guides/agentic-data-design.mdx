# Agentic data design (beta)

Agentic data design in Avo uses purpose-built AI agents to help you design analytics faster and with higher quality. Within the Journey builder, agents can propose triggers from screenshots and suggest reuse of existing events and variants, turning a documentation-heavy process into a guided, visual workflow.

Benefits:

- Speed up design by generating high‑quality starting points
- Reduce duplication by reusing existing events/variants
- Keep non‑experts productive with clear, visual suggestions that tie back to the tracking plan

## Agentic data design types

Currently you can use AI to perform the following actions in the journey builder (more coming soon):

### Generate Triggers
You can have AI analyze journey step screenshots for you and propose a trigger name and description. That helps you quickly capture the exact interaction(s) to track on each screen and generate multiple triggers with a click of a button.

You can provide context for the AI in the following ways:
- Add a custom prompt to the AI menu above the step
- Connect journey steps to each other and then the AI will generate relevant triggers for each step based on the subsequent journey step(s)

### Reuse Events and Variants
You can have AI look up your tracking plan to suggest existing events or variants that best match a trigger. This helps you prevent duplicate events and speeds up mapping triggers → events/variants. And enables those that don't know the tracking plan in and out to identify relevant events and variants.
