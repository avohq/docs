# Organizing your tracking plan

Avo provides multiple, complementary ways to organize a tracking plan at any scale. Use them together to keep data consistent, navigable, and accountable:

- Global and Local Workspaces: centralized governance with local flexibility
- Stakeholders: organize by ownership and dependencies across teams
- Categories: visual grouping across events, variants, and metrics; items can belong to multiple categories and categories are shared across items
- Tags: flexible labels on events, variants, and properties; items can have multiple tags and tags are shared across items
- Property bundles: reusable sets of properties you can attach to many events and variants for speed and consistency
- Metrics: analysis structure that brings together events, variants, and properties

Below we cover each, then how they work together, and practical examples.

## Multi-workspace organizations

Most organizations are best served by a single workspace for their tracking plan—even if they have more than one product. Some organizations, however, have multiple products that are largely unrelated and share only a small subset of events and properties. In that case, it can be best to keep a single workspace for shared events and properties and create local workspaces for products that are not related to the shared definitions.

Global workspaces let a central team define core events and properties that should be shared across multiple local workspaces. Local workspaces adopt these global requirements and can extend them to the needs of their product within the constraints of the global definitions. Local workspaces can create variants of global events and add their own events that describe their product in a unique way. This model provides consistency across products while preserving local flexibility.

## Stakeholder teams

Stakeholder teams represent functions or product areas in your organization. Assigning teams as owners or stakeholders on events and variants makes accountability explicit, routes reviews to the right people, and surfaces cross‑team impact. Create stakeholder teams, assign them to items as owners or stakeholders, and use filters in Branches, Events, and Properties tables to focus by team.

## Categories

Categories provide intuitive, visual groupings across Events, Variants, and Metrics, making navigation and planning easier. Items can belong to multiple shared categories, and these categories can be published to destinations that support them (for example, Mixpanel and Amplitude) so your analytics tools mirror the same grouping. Use categories to group events and metrics for an intuitive overview of your tracking plan and to filter views by product area, journey, or feature set.

## Tags

Tags are lightweight labels for workflows and governance across Events, Variants, and Properties. Items can have multiple tags and tags are shared across items. Use tags to encode policies and processes—common patterns include PII, priority (P0/P1/P2), and lifecycle (deprecated or a scheduled deprecation date). You can filter tables by tags to focus your view.

## Property bundles

Property bundles let you package commonly used event properties into reusable sets you can attach to many events at once. They speed up data design, reduce mistakes, and keep shared definitions consistent across your tracking plan.

## Metrics

Metrics define desired outcomes and connect the events, variants, and properties used to analyze them. Starting from metrics aligns data collection with business impact: define the metric, associate the events/variants/properties required to measure it, and create any missing pieces directly from the metric view. Categories and tags help navigate large sets of metrics.

## How these work together

- Global workspaces define shared, governed structures; local workspaces extend and implement
- Stakeholders own and depend on items within workspaces, enabling impact visibility and routed reviews
- Categories provide visual grouping across items and are published to supported destinations
- Tags add flexible labeling for additional context and filtering options
- Property bundles standardize commonly used properties and accelerate consistent event design
- Metrics connect the pieces to business outcomes

| Organizer | Primary purpose | Applies to | Filters | Multi-assign | Published downstream |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Global/Local Workspaces | Central governance with local flexibility | Events, properties | - | - | - |
| Stakeholders | Ownership & dependencies | Events, variants, properties | ✅ | Owner: single; Stakeholders: many |  ✅ (Webhook) |
| Categories | Visual grouping & navigation | Events, variants, metrics | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (Webhook, Mixpanel*, Amplitude) |
| Tags | Flexible labeling & workflows | Events, variants, properties | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (Webhook, Mixpanel, Segment Protocols) |
| Property bundles | Reusable sets of properties for consistency | Properties attached to events | ❌ | ✅  | ❌ |
| Metrics | Analysis structure tying items together | Events, variants, properties | ✅ | ✅| ✅ (Webhook) |

* Mixpanel Lexicon publishing can be set to receive category in Avo as tags in Mixpanel as Mixpanel doesn't support categories.

## Practical examples

There are many ways to organize a tracking plan, and the best approach depends on the size and complexity of your organization and the products you are tracking. Below are two common approaches for very different organizations.

### Multi‑workspace enterprise
- Global workspace for central definitions and local workspaces for products
- Stakeholders map to analysts serving more than one development team, where each analyst leads a stakeholder team
- Categories map to product areas, sometimes representing development teams
- Tags used to mark properties as PII, and to label events, properties, and variants for priority and items in the process of being deprecated
- Property bundles used to standardize common property sets across many events and products, both in the global workspace and in the local workspaces
- Metrics defined centrally for shared outcomes (e.g., retention, conversion); local workspaces add product‑specific metrics

### Growth‑stage startup
- Single workspace
- Stakeholders map to development teams, where an analyst or a PM leads stakeholder teams
- Categories map to product areas
- Tags used to mark properties as PII, and to label events, properties, and variants for priority and items in the process of being deprecated
- Property bundles used to group properties together and speed up data design
- Metrics drive planning: define key outcomes first, then associate events/variants/properties to build the metrics
