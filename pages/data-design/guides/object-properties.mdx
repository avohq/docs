# Defining object properties

In your Avo Tracking Plan properties can have 5 different types, string, integer, float, boolean and object. Learn more about properties in general [in this doc](/data-design/avo-tracking-plan/properties).

In this guide we'll go through the process of defining an object property, including constraints on its keys and values.

  The object type is currently behind a feature flag. Reach out to us if you
  want to start defining object properties in your tracking plan.

### Step 1: Set the property type to object

Click the type dropdown in the property drawer and select "object"

2. Add the properties you'd like to include in the object
   <Callout>
     All properties in Avo are shared globally throughout the tracking plan,
     this includes the sub-properties of object properties. You can [learn more
     about the global namespace in Avo in this
     doc](/data-design/global-namespace).
