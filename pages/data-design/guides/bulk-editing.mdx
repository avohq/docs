# Bulk Editing

**Bulk editing** is a powerful workflow tool in Avo that allows you to efficiently update multiple items simultaneously. Instead of editing items one by one, you can select multiple items and apply changes to shared attributes across all of them at once.

Bulk editing is available in two main areas:
- [**Events view**](#bulk-editing-in-events-view): Bulk edit events in your tracking plan
- [**Inspector Issues view**](#bulk-editing-in-inspector-issues-view): Bulk manage inspector issues

## How to use bulk editing

### Bulk editing in Events view

Bulk editing can be accessed from the Events view and allows you to modify shared attributes across multiple events efficiently.

#### Accessing bulk editing

To start bulk editing:

1. Navigate to the Events view in your tracking plan
2. Select the events you want to edit using one of these methods:
   - **Individual selection**: Check the boxes next to specific events
   - **Category selection**: Check the box next to a category name to select all events in that category
   - **Multiple selection**: Use Cmd/Ctrl + click to select non-adjacent events

3. Once events are selected, the bulk editing toolbar will appear at the bottom of the screen
4. Choose the attribute you want to modify from the toolbar options

#### Available bulk editing actions

The bulk editing toolbar provides options to modify these shared attributes:

- **Event Properties**: Add or remove properties from multiple events
- **Sources**: Add or remove sources from multiple events  
- **Tags**: Apply or remove tags across multiple events
- **Categories**: Add events to categories or remove them from categories
- **Stakeholders**: Assign or remove stakeholder teams from multiple events

### Bulk editing in Inspector Issues view

Bulk editing is also available in the [Inspector Issues view](/inspector/inspector-issues-view) to help you efficiently manage multiple data quality issues at once.

#### Accessing bulk editing in Inspector Issues

To start bulk editing issues:

1. Navigate to the Inspector Issues view
2. Select the issues you want to manage using one of these methods:
   - **Individual selection**: Check the boxes next to specific issues
   - **Multiple selection**: Use Cmd/Ctrl + click to select non-adjacent issues

3. Once issues are selected, the bulk action toolbar will appear at the bottom of the screen
4. Choose the action you want to apply from the toolbar options

![Bulk editing Inspectorissues](/images/best-practices/bulk-editing/bulk-edit-inspector-issues.png)

#### Available bulk actions for Inspector Issues

The bulk action toolbar provides options to:

- **Ignore**: Mark multiple issues as ignored if you're not planning to fix them
- **Resolve in...**: Mark multiple issues as resolved, specifying the version or time frame
  - 1 hour from now
  - 24 hours from now

This is particularly useful when you have multiple related issues that need the same resolution status, such as after deploying a fix that resolves several data quality issues at once.

## Use cases for bulk editing

Bulk editing is particularly valuable for several workflow scenarios. Here are common use cases with step-by-step guidance:

**For tracking plan events**: See [Bulk editing in Events view](#bulk-editing-in-events-view)  
**For Inspector Issues**: See [Bulk editing in Inspector Issues view](#bulk-editing-in-inspector-issues-view)

### Planning new features with fast creation + bulk editing

One of the most efficient workflows in Avo combines [fast event creation methods](/data-design/avo-tracking-plan/events#fast-event-creation-methods) with bulk editing to rapidly plan and define new features. See [Bulk editing in Events view](#bulk-editing-in-events-view) for setup instructions.

**Example scenario**: Your team is planning a new checkout flow that requires 8 new events. Rather than creating each event individually with full configuration, you can use a two-step approach.

<details>
<summary><strong>Steps to plan new features with fast creation + bulk editing</strong></summary>

**Step 1: Fast creation to capture all event names**

Use Avo's [fast creation methods](/data-design/avo-tracking-plan/events#fast-event-creation-methods) to quickly capture all the events you need.

**Step 2: Bulk editing to add context and configuration**

Now select all your newly created events and use bulk editing to efficiently add:

1. **Add shared sources**:
   - Select all 8 checkout events
   - Click "Source" in bulk editing toolbar → "Add Source"
   - Add Web, iOS, and Android sources with "Implement with Codegen" enabled

2. **Categorize events**:
   - With events still selected
   - Click "Category" → "Add to Category" 
   - Add to "Checkout" or "E-commerce" category

3. **Add stakeholders**:
   - Click "Stakeholder" → assign to Checkout team and Product Analytics team

4. **Apply consistent tagging**:
   - Click "Tag" → add tags like "Tier 1 - Revenue" or "New Feature"

5. **Add common properties** (if applicable):
   - Click "Event Property" → add shared properties "Onboarding Step" or property bundles like "Onboarding properties"

**Benefits of this workflow**:
- **Speed**: Capture all event names in 2-3 minutes vs. 15-20 minutes creating each individually
- **Focus**: Separate ideation (naming) from configuration (details)
- **Consistency**: Bulk editing ensures all related events have identical setup
- **Collaboration**: Great for workshop sessions where you brainstorm events first, then configure together

<Callout type="info" emoji="⚡">
**Workshop Tip**: This approach is particularly effective during [purpose meetings](/data-design/guides/documenting-purpose-meetings-in-avo) where stakeholders brainstorm events together. First capture all the event names everyone suggests, then systematically add the detailed context as a group.

### Consolidating redundant categories

When you have multiple categories that serve the same purpose, you can efficiently consolidate them using [Events view bulk editing](#bulk-editing-in-events-view):

**Example scenario**: You have both "User Authentication" and "Login/Signup" categories that should be merged into a single "Authentication" category.

<details>
<summary><strong>Steps to consolidate</strong></summary>

1. **Create a new branch** for your category management changes
2. **Navigate to the Events view** and scroll to the redundant category section
3. **Select all events in the redundant category** by checking the box next to the category name
4. **Use bulk editing to add them to the source of truth category**:
   - Click "Category" in the bulk editing toolbar
   - Select "Add to Category" 
   - Choose your target category (e.g., "Authentication")
5. **Remove events from the redundant category**:
   - With the same events still selected
   - Click "Category" in the bulk editing toolbar
   - Select "Remove from Category"
   - Choose the redundant category to remove
6. **Archive the redundant category**:
   - Use Cmd+K to search for the redundant category
   - Open the category and archive it
7. **Repeat for other redundant categories** as needed

*This workflow ensures events are moved efficiently without losing their categorization, and prevents future use of inconsistent category names.*

### Updating event sources

Use [Events view bulk editing](#bulk-editing-in-events-view) to efficiently update sources across multiple events.

**Example scenario**: You're launching a new mobile app and need to add the new iOS source to existing mobile-relevant events.

<details>
<summary><strong>Steps to update event sources</strong></summary>

1. **Filter events** that should be available on mobile
2. **Select events** using categories like "Core User Actions" or "E-commerce"
3. **Bulk add the new source**:
   - Click "Source" in the bulk editing toolbar  
   - Select "Add Source"
   - Choose your new iOS source
   - Configure "Implement with Codegen" as needed

</details>

### Team stakeholder assignment

Use [Events view bulk editing](#bulk-editing-in-events-view) to assign stakeholders across related events and establish clear data governance.

**Example scenario**: The Growth team is becoming a stakeholder in all onboarding and acquisition events.

<details>
<summary><strong>Steps to assign stakeholders</strong></summary>

1. **Select events** in onboarding and acquisition categories
2. **Bulk assign stakeholder teams**:
   - Click "Stakeholder" in the bulk editing toolbar
   - Add the Growth team as stakeholders 
   - Apply across all selected events

</details>

### Removing deprecated properties

Use [Events view bulk editing](#bulk-editing-in-events-view) to efficiently remove properties from multiple events.

**Example scenario**: A legacy property needs to be removed from multiple events after a product redesign.

<details>
<summary><strong>Steps to remove deprecated properties</strong></summary>

1. **Search for events** containing the deprecated property
2. **Select all relevant events** from the search results
3. **Bulk remove the property**:
   - Click "Event Property" in the bulk editing toolbar
   - Select "Remove Property" 
   - Choose the deprecated property to remove

</details>

### Managing Inspector Issues after deployment

Bulk editing in the Inspector Issues view is particularly valuable after deploying fixes that resolve multiple data quality issues. See [Bulk editing in Inspector Issues view](#bulk-editing-in-inspector-issues-view) for setup instructions.

**Example scenario**: Your team deployed a fix that resolved 15 property type issues across multiple events. Rather than manually resolving each issue individually, you can use bulk actions.

<details>
<summary><strong>Steps to bulk resolve Inspector Issues</strong></summary>

1. **Navigate to Inspector Issues view** and filter to show the resolved issues
2. **Select all related issues** by checking the boxes next to the issues that were fixed in your deployment
3. **Use bulk actions to resolve**:
   - Click "Resolve in..." in the bulk action toolbar
   - Select the appropriate resolution criteria:
     - Choose "in 1 hour" if the fix rolling out in the next hour
     - Choose "in 24 hours" if the fix will rolling out in the next 24 hours
4. **Verify resolution**: The issues will move to the "Resolved" section and will be marked as regressions if they reappear

**Benefits of this workflow**:
- **Efficiency**: Resolve 15+ issues in seconds vs. minutes of individual resolution
- **Consistency**: Ensure all related issues have the same resolution status
- **Tracking**: Maintain clear records of when and how issues were resolved

</details>

## Best practices for bulk editing

### Planning your changes

- **Work on branches**: Always make bulk changes on a feature branch to review before merging
- **Document your intent**: Use clear branch names and descriptions for bulk editing branches
- **Review before applying**: Double-check your selection before executing bulk actions

### Efficient selection strategies

- **Use category selection**: Select entire categories when working with related events
- **Combine filters**: Use the Events view filters to narrow down to relevant events before selecting
- **Preview changes**: Review which events are selected before applying bulk actions

### Managing complex changes

- **Break down large changes**: For extensive reorganization, work in smaller, focused batches
- **Coordinate with stakeholders**: Communicate bulk changes that affect events owned by other teams
- **Test incrementally**: When changing event structure, test with a subset before applying to all events

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
**Workflow Tip**: Bulk editing pairs perfectly with Avo's [fast event creation methods](/data-design/avo-tracking-plan/events#fast-event-creation-methods). Create multiple events quickly, then use bulk editing to add detailed context and configuration efficiently.
