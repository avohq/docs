# Bulk Editing

**Bulk editing** is a powerful workflow tool in Avo that allows you to efficiently update multiple events simultaneously. Instead of editing events one by one, you can select multiple events and apply changes to shared attributes across all of them at once.

## How to use bulk editing

Bulk editing can be accessed from the Events view and allows you to modify shared attributes across multiple events efficiently.

### Accessing bulk editing

To start bulk editing:

1. Navigate to the Events view in your tracking plan
2. Select the events you want to edit using one of these methods:
   - **Individual selection**: Check the boxes next to specific events
   - **Category selection**: Check the box next to a category name to select all events in that category
   - **Multiple selection**: Use Cmd/Ctrl + click to select non-adjacent events

3. Once events are selected, the bulk editing toolbar will appear at the bottom of the screen
4. Choose the attribute you want to modify from the toolbar options

### Available bulk editing actions

The bulk editing toolbar provides options to modify these shared attributes:

- **Event Properties**: Add or remove properties from multiple events
- **Sources**: Add or remove sources from multiple events  
- **Tags**: Apply or remove tags across multiple events
- **Categories**: Add events to categories or remove them from categories
- **Stakeholders**: Assign or remove stakeholder teams from multiple events

## Use cases for bulk editing

Bulk editing is particularly valuable for several workflow scenarios. Here are common use cases with step-by-step guidance:

### Planning new features with fast creation + bulk editing

One of the most efficient workflows in Avo combines [fast event creation methods](/data-design/avo-tracking-plan/events#fast-event-creation-methods) with bulk editing to rapidly plan and define new features.

**Example scenario**: Your team is planning a new checkout flow that requires 8 new events. Rather than creating each event individually with full configuration, you can use a two-step approach.

**Step 1: Fast creation to capture all event names**

Use Avo's [fast creation methods](/data-design/avo-tracking-plan/events#fast-event-creation-methods) to quickly capture all the events you need.

**Step 2: Bulk editing to add context and configuration**

Now select all your newly created events and use bulk editing to efficiently add:

1. **Add shared sources**:
   - Select all 8 checkout events
   - Click "Source" in bulk editing toolbar â†’ "Add Source"
   - Add Web, iOS, and Android sources with "Implement with Codegen" enabled

2. **Categorize events**:
   - With events still selected
   - Click "Category" â†’ "Add to Category" 
   - Add to "Checkout" or "E-commerce" category

3. **Add stakeholders**:
   - Click "Stakeholder" â†’ assign to Checkout team and Product Analytics team

4. **Apply consistent tagging**:
   - Click "Tag" â†’ add tags like "Tier 1 - Revenue" or "New Feature"

5. **Add common properties** (if applicable):
   - Click "Event Property" â†’ add shared properties "Onboarding Step" or property bundles like "Onboarding properties"

**Benefits of this workflow**:
- **Speed**: Capture all event names in 2-3 minutes vs. 15-20 minutes creating each individually
- **Focus**: Separate ideation (naming) from configuration (details)
- **Consistency**: Bulk editing ensures all related events have identical setup
- **Collaboration**: Great for workshop sessions where you brainstorm events first, then configure together

<Callout type="info" emoji="âš¡">
**Workshop Tip**: This approach is particularly effective during [purpose meetings](/data-design/guides/documenting-purpose-meetings-in-avo) where stakeholders brainstorm events together. First capture all the event names everyone suggests, then systematically add the detailed context as a group.

### Consolidating redundant categories

When you have multiple categories that serve the same purpose, you can efficiently consolidate them:

**Example scenario**: You have both "User Authentication" and "Login/Signup" categories that should be merged into a single "Authentication" category.

**Steps to consolidate**:

1. **Create a new branch** for your category management changes
2. **Navigate to the Events view** and scroll to the redundant category section
3. **Select all events in the redundant category** by checking the box next to the category name
4. **Use bulk editing to add them to the source of truth category**:
   - Click "Category" in the bulk editing toolbar
   - Select "Add to Category" 
   - Choose your target category (e.g., "Authentication")
5. **Remove events from the redundant category**:
   - With the same events still selected
   - Click "Category" in the bulk editing toolbar
   - Select "Remove from Category"
   - Choose the redundant category to remove
6. **Archive the redundant category**:
   - Use Cmd+K to search for the redundant category
   - Open the category and archive it
7. **Repeat for other redundant categories** as needed

*This workflow ensures events are moved efficiently without losing their categorization, and prevents future use of inconsistent category names.*

### Updating event sources

**Example scenario**: You're launching a new mobile app and need to add the new iOS source to existing mobile-relevant events.

**Steps**:

1. **Filter events** that should be available on mobile
2. **Select events** using categories like "Core User Actions" or "E-commerce"
3. **Bulk add the new source**:
   - Click "Source" in the bulk editing toolbar  
   - Select "Add Source"
   - Choose your new iOS source
   - Configure "Implement with Codegen" as needed

### Team stakeholder assignment

Assigning stakeholders across related events helps establish clear data governance.

**Example scenario**: The Growth team is becoming a stakeholder in all onboarding and acquisition events.

**Steps**:

1. **Select events** in onboarding and acquisition categories
2. **Bulk assign stakeholder teams**:
   - Click "Stakeholder" in the bulk editing toolbar
   - Add the Growth team as stakeholders 
   - Apply across all selected events

### Removing deprecated properties

**Example scenario**: A legacy property needs to be removed from multiple events after a product redesign.

**Steps**:

1. **Search for events** containing the deprecated property
2. **Select all relevant events** from the search results
3. **Bulk remove the property**:
   - Click "Event Property" in the bulk editing toolbar
   - Select "Remove Property" 
   - Choose the deprecated property to remove

## Best practices for bulk editing

### Planning your changes

- **Work on branches**: Always make bulk changes on a feature branch to review before merging
- **Document your intent**: Use clear branch names and descriptions for bulk editing branches
- **Review before applying**: Double-check your selection before executing bulk actions

### Efficient selection strategies

- **Use category selection**: Select entire categories when working with related events
- **Combine filters**: Use the Events view filters to narrow down to relevant events before selecting
- **Preview changes**: Review which events are selected before applying bulk actions

### Managing complex changes

- **Break down large changes**: For extensive reorganization, work in smaller, focused batches
- **Coordinate with stakeholders**: Communicate bulk changes that affect events owned by other teams
- **Test incrementally**: When changing event structure, test with a subset before applying to all events

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
**Workflow Tip**: Bulk editing pairs perfectly with Avo's [fast event creation methods](/data-design/avo-tracking-plan/events#fast-event-creation-methods). Create multiple events quickly, then use bulk editing to add detailed context and configuration efficiently.
