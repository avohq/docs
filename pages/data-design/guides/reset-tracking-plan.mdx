### What happens when I reset my Tracking Plan?

Tracking Plan reset removes all events, properties, metrics, tags, categories and publishing integrations from your workspace. The reset will also close all currently open branches.

Sources, destinations, workspace members and permissions, Slack integrations and Inspector will not be affected by the reset.
