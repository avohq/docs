# Branch changes

Use the Branch changes view to prepare, review, and implement analytics updates in one place. It brings together context for reviewers, a clear diff of your tracking plan, and copy‚Äëready implementation instructions.

- Align stakeholders on why the changes exist and what they enable
- Review and approve the exact tracking plan changes with powerful filters
- Hand developers precise code diffs and snippets per source

  Branch changes is composed of three tabs: <strong>Branch context</strong>, <strong>Tracking plan changes</strong>, and <strong>Code changes</strong>.
</Callout>

## The three tabs

### Branch context
- Add a description of the change and its related product update; link design docs or tickets
- Rename the branch when needed
- See collaborators and impacted stakeholders
- Use this to set expectations before reviewers dive into the diffs

### Tracking plan changes
- A structured diff of events, properties, metrics, and related items
- Filter with ‚ÄúShow changes since‚Äù to focus reviews on what‚Äôs new
- Comment and resolve feedback on each changed item

### Code changes
- Implementation view grouped by source with configurable diffs
- Copyable, language‚Äëappropriate code snippets for both Codegen and non‚ÄëCodegen
- Share links internally or create a public share for external collaborators
