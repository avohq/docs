# Branch review screen

Use the Branch review screen to prepare, review, and implement analytics updates in one place. It brings together context for reviewers, a clear diff of your tracking plan, and copy‚Äëready implementation instructions.

- Align stakeholders on why the changes exist and what they enable
- Review and approve the exact tracking plan changes with powerful filters
- Hand developers precise code diffs and snippets per event per source

<Callout type="info" emoji="üí°">
  Branch review screen is composed of three tabs: <strong>Branch context</strong>, <strong>Tracking plan changes</strong>, and <strong>Code changes</strong>.
</Callout>

## The three tabs

### Branch context
Use Branch context to align reviewers on the purpose and scope of the branch before they dive into the changes.

![Branch context tab](/images/branches/branch-context-tab.png)

- Add a branch description including a concise description of the product updates the branch is related to and the tracking plan changes described in the branch
- Add links to product specs, designs, tickets or other relevant resources so reviewers have all context to review
- Rename the branch as scope evolves to keep branch lists clear without breaking links

### Tracking plan changes
Use Tracking plan changes to review and approve the exact modifications to your tracking plan and to manage the review workflow.

![Tracking plan changes tab](/images/branches/tracking-plan-changes-tab.png)

- See a structured diff of metrics, events, properties, and related items vs. main; focus on what‚Äôs new since your last review using ‚ÄúShow changes since‚Äù
- Comment on changed items to ask questions, record decisions, and resolve feedback
- Add or remove reviewers and change the branch status (Draft, Ready for review, Changes requested, Approved) to keep work moving

In the Events view, the [Workbench](/data-design/avo-tracking-plan/workbench) highlights added or updated events, giving you an at‚Äëa‚Äëglance view of changes useful for self‚Äëreview while making changes to the tracking plan.

### Code changes
Use Code changes to translate tracking plan diffs into precise implementation instructions for developers.

![Code changes tab](/images/branches/code-changes-tab.png)

- Scan impacted events grouped by source with configurable diffs to understand exactly what to change in code
- Copy language‚Äëappropriate snippets for both Codegen and non‚ÄëCodegen to speed up implementation and reduce errors
- Share links internally or create a public share to collaborate with people outside your workspace
