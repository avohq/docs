    - Stefania commented on the authentication config property on the main branch: "Should we have auto login as a property value here when we auto login the customer from the landing page?"
- Collaborators:
  - Collaborator added
  - Collaborator removed
  - Example:

## Stakeholder team notifications

In addition to workspace-wide Slack notifications, individual stakeholder teams can receive targeted notifications when branches impact their tracking plan items (events and event variants).

### Setting up stakeholder team notifications

1. Navigate to **Workspace Settings** ⚙️ > **Stakeholders**
2. Select the stakeholder team you want to configure
3. In the **Slack notifications** section, connect a Slack channel to the team
4. Configure notification preferences in the stakeholder team settings:
   - **As impacted owner** - Notifications when the team owns tracking plan items being modified
   - **As impacted stakeholder** - Notifications when the team is a stakeholder in tracking plan items being modified
   - **As stakeholder reviewer** - Notifications when manually added as a branch reviewer

### Team vs workspace notifications

- **Workspace notifications** go to a single channel and cover all branch activity
- **Stakeholder team notifications** go to team-specific channels and only notify about branches impacting that team's stakeholder events
- Teams can receive notifications whether they're automatically added as required reviewers or choose notification-only involvement

Learn more about configuring stakeholder team settings in [Managing Stakeholder Teams](/workspace-management/domains).
