# Branch Notifications

Keep track of branches in progress and prevent them to get stuck in the review process by setting up Slack notifications. Avo offers two types of branch notifications:

- **Workspace notifications** - Broad notifications about all branch activity sent to a single workspace channel
- **Stakeholder team notifications** - Targeted notifications sent to team-specific channels when branches impact their stakeholder items

Both notification types include real-time notifications for branch activity and review reminders for branches awaiting review.

## Workspace Notifications

Workspace notifications provide visibility into all branch activity across your workspace and are sent to a single Slack channel. Users who need to take action (such as reviewers) are @-mentioned in the notifications.

Workspace notifications include:
- **Real-time notifications** - Immediate alerts when branch events occur
- **Review reminders** - Periodic reminders for branches marked as "Ready for review" to prevent them from getting stuck

### Types of real-time workspace notifications

- **Branch status updates** - Status changes for all branches in the workspace
  - Branch created
  - Ready for review 
  - Approved
  - Changes requested
  - Merged
  - Closed
  - Reverted to draft
  - Example: *Solvi approved the onboarding-funnel branch 🎉*

- **Comments:** – All comments made in the workspace, with Slack @-mentions for the member mentioned in the Avo comment
  - New comment added
  - Examples:
    - *Solvi commented on the Account Created event on the onboarding-funnel branch: "@Stefania should we include the role property?"*
    - *Stefania commented on the authentication config property on the main branch: "@Solvi should we have auto login as a property value here when we auto login the customer from the landing page?"*

- **Member involvement changes:** - All branch member involvement changes, with @-mentions for member being added or removed
  - Branch reviewer added
  - Branch reviewer removed
  - Collaborator added
  - Collaborator removed
  - Example: *Stefania added @solvi as a collaborator on the onboarding-funnel branch*

### Review reminders

For branches marked as "Ready for review", Avo sends periodic reminder notifications to ensure they don't get stuck in the review process. These reminders:

- Are sent once a day to the workspace channel with @-mentions for the assigned reviewers for each branch
- Include a summary of how long the branch has been waiting for review
- Help maintain momentum in the approval workflow

#### Configuring review reminders

Review reminders can be configured in your workspace Slack integration settings:

1. Navigate to **Workspace Settings** ⚙️ > **Slack Integration**
2. Ensure your workspace is connected to Slack
3. Toggle on **Scheduled branch reminders**
4. Configure your reminder schedule:
   - **Frequency**: Choose daily reminders or weekdays only
   - **Time**: Set the specific time for reminders (e.g., 9:00 AM)
   - **Timezone**: Select your team's timezone (e.g., Atlantic/Reykjavik)

The reminders will be sent at your configured time and include all branches that are currently pending review, helping ensure nothing gets overlooked.

## Stakeholder Team Notifications

Stakeholder team notifications are targeted alerts sent to team-specific Slack channels when branches contain changes that impact their stakeholder items (events, event variants, and properties) based on each [stakeholder team settings](/workspace-management/domains#stakeholder-team-settings). Team members who need to take action are @-mentioned in the notifications.

### How stakeholder notifications work

Stakeholder team notifications include:
- **[Real-time notifications](#types-of-real-time-stakeholder-notifications)** - Immediate alerts when branches impact the team's stakeholder items
- **[Review reminders](#review-reminders-for-stakeholder-teams-coming-soon)** - Periodic reminders for branches awaiting review from the stakeholder team

Stakeholder notifications are triggered based on the relationship between the stakeholder team and the items being modified and the [stakeholder team settings](/workspace-management/domains#stakeholder-team-settings):

- **As impacted owner** - Notifications when the team owns items being modified in a branch 
- **As impacted stakeholder** - Notifications when the team is assigned as a stakeholder to items being modified
- **As stakeholder reviewer** - Notifications when the team is manually added as a branch reviewer 

The notifications are sent to the team's designated Slack channel and only include information about branches that impact their specific stakeholder items.


### Types of real-time stakeholder notifications

Unlike workspace notifications that cover all branch activity, stakeholder notifications are triggered for branches that impact the team's stakeholder items:

- **Branch status updates** - Status changes for branches that impact the team's stakeholder items
  - Branch created
  - Ready for review 
  - Approved
  - Changes requested
  - Merged
  - Closed
  - Reverted to draft
  - Example: *The branch onboarding-funnel has been marked as approved. Stakeholder team Onboarding is an impacted owner of 3 events and 1 property.*

- **Comments:** – Comments made on branches that impact the team's stakeholder items, with Slack @-mentions for the member mentioned in the Avo comment
  - New comment added
  - Examples:
    - Solvi mentioned a stakeholder team member on the branch onboarding-funnel: "@Stefania should we include the role property?"

- **Member involvement changes:** - The stakeholder team is added or removed as a reviewer on a branch, with @-mentions for team members who need to review
  - Branch reviewer added
  - Branch reviewer removed
  - Collaborator added
  - Collaborator removed
  - Example: *Stefania asked @Solvi to review the branch onboarding-funnel. Stakeholder team Onboarding is an impacted stakeholder of 3 events and 1 property.*

### Review reminders for stakeholder teams (coming soon)

For branches that impact a stakeholder team's items and are awaiting their review, Avo sends periodic reminder notifications to team-specific channels based on the stakeholder notification settings. These reminders:

- Are sent once a day to the stakeholder team channel with @-mentions for the assigned reviewers for each branch
- Focus only on branches that impact the team's stakeholder items
- Include context about which specific items impact the stakeholder team
- Help ensure stakeholder teams don't miss reviews for changes affecting their stakeholder team
- Are configured according to each stakeholder team's individual settings

### Setting up and configuring stakeholder team notifications

#### Setting up stakeholder team notifications

1. Navigate to **Workspace Settings** ⚙️ > **Stakeholders**
2. Select the stakeholder team you want to configure
3. In the **Slack notifications** section, connect a Slack channel to the team
4. Configure notification preferences in the stakeholder team settings for each scenario:
   - **As impacted owner** - Choose notification preferences when the team owns items being modified
   - **As impacted stakeholder** - Choose notification preferences when the team is a stakeholder in items being modified  
   - **As stakeholder reviewer** - Choose notification preferences when manually added as a reviewer

Available options include:
- **Automatically add as required reviewer** - Team is added as required reviewer and receives notifications (Enterprise plan)
- **Notify in stakeholder Slack channel** - Team receives notifications without being required to approve
- **Do nothing** - No automatic action or notifications

#### Configuring stakeholder team review reminders

Review reminders for stakeholder teams are configured as part of each team's individual stakeholder settings, not at the workspace level:

1. Navigate to **Workspace Settings** ⚙️ > **Stakeholders**
2. Select the stakeholder team you want to configure
3. Configure the team's notification preferences for each scenario:
   - **As impacted owner** - When the team owns items being modified
   - **As impacted stakeholder** - When the team is a stakeholder in items being modified
   - **As stakeholder reviewer** - When manually added as a branch reviewer

Teams that choose "Automatically add as required reviewer" or "Notify in stakeholder Slack channel" will receive review reminders according to their configured preferences.

### When to use each type

- **Use workspace notifications** for general visibility into all branch activity across your workspace, with real-time alerts and review reminders ensuring actionable items don't get missed
- **Use stakeholder team notifications** for targeted alerts when specific teams need to be aware of changes impacting their domain, with focused review reminders for team members who need to review or approve
- **Use both together** for comprehensive notification coverage - workspace notifications for general awareness and stakeholder notifications for targeted team involvement, both with real-time alerts and smart review reminders to keep branches moving through the approval process
