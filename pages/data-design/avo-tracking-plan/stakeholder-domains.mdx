# Stakeholder Domains

In Avo, you can assign one or multiple domains as stakeholders to events and event variants in your tracking plan. This is vital for large organizations sharing a schema registry, to better define areas of accountability and ownership. It makes it clear which schemas are relevant to each function or team within the organization and – more importantly – streamlines the workflow for when changes are suggested on shared data structures.

## Domains

A domain refers to a certain function or area within your organization. It could be a product area (Search, Checkout, etc), an entire app for specific personas (Drivers, Riders, etc) or a business function independent of the product (Marketing, Sales, Finance, etc.).

## Stakeholders

A domain should be assigned as a stakeholder on an event if it depends on the event and/or is directly accountable for implementing it and ensuring it’s being sent correctly.

By having assigned stakeholder domains on events, it’s clear to anyone navigating your tracking plan who is relying on which events and who to loop in if an issue comes up with an event or when changes are suggested to shared data structures.

When suggesting changes on a branch, you'll also see an [indicator of which stakeholders will be impacted](data-design/guides/managing-changes-impacting-multiple-stakeholders), so you can avoid unwanted impact on other domains and/or loop the right people in to coordinate a cross-domain ananalytics change.

### Stakeholders in the tracking plan

In the Events table in your tracking plan, you will see a column labeled “Stakeholders”. This column shows which domain each event is assigned to. You can filter your events table by stakeholders and share the filtered view with the domain team to give everyone a clearer overview of the events relevant to them.

In the details view for each event or event variant, you can see which domains are stakeholders in the item. To easily connect the dots between the stakeholder domain and the people behind it, click the domain name to see a preview of the domain members or navigate to the domain details view.

### Stakeholders in the branched workflow

When a user in your workspace drafts changes on a branch in Avo, the “Impacted stakeholders” indicator in the branch header keeps track of how many stakeholder domains will be impacted by the suggested changes.

From there you can choose to [tweak the changes to reduce the scope](#minimizing-stakeholder-impact), or [loop in the relevant stakeholders](#aligning-on-cross-domain-changes).

#### From the Domain details view

From the domain details view you can search all events and filter by category or tag to attach multiple events to the domain in one go. [See instructions](/workspace-management/domains).

#### Who can assign domains as stakeholders
