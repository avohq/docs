# Stakeholders

In Avo, a **Stakeholder Team** is a group of people working within a specific function or area of your organization.  
It could be a product area (Search, Checkout), an entire app team (Drivers, Riders), or a business function that operates independently of the product (Central Data, Marketing, Finance).

Each stakeholder team has different data needs and they need to be able to influence what data they get access to.
But they have different access to the ability to generate the data they need.
For instance: the finance team will need the product team to generate events related to the user experience so they can measure retention to predict financial outcomes. 

By documenting stakeholders and owners (alpha) on the events in your tracking plan, anyone is able to understand who is relying on which events and who to loop in when changes are made or if an issue comes up.

This structure is especially valuable for large organizations managing a shared schema registry.  
It clarifies which teams are responsible for which parts of the tracking plan—and, more importantly, streamlines workflows when changes are proposed to shared data structures.

## Stakeholder Teams

A Stakeholder Team consists of:
- **Team Members** — individuals with subject matter expertise
- **Stakeholder Items** — the events and variants the team depends on, owns, or both

### Stakeholder Team Members

These are the individuals who share expertise in the area the team represents. One workspace member can be a part of one or multiple stakeholder teams.

**Roles and privileges** (alpha):
- **Lead**: Each Stakeholder Team must have a Lead that is its primary contact and the person ultimately responsible for the tracking plan items tied to the team. This role doesn't need to mirror your org chart.
- **Member**: All other Stakeholder Team participants.
- **Can approve**: Members who are allowed to approve branches on behalf of the team.

[Stakeholder members can be added to a Stakeholder team](/workspace-management/domains#adding-stakeholder-team-members) from the stakeholder details.

### Stakeholder Items

These are the events and variants relevant to the team’s area of ownership or dependency.

If a team is assigned as a stakeholder:
- It’s clear who relies on which events.
- It’s easy to know who to contact when questions or issues arise.
- Everyone can see who should review proposed changes to shared structures.

When changes are made to an event that a stakeholder team is assigned to:
- An [indicator shows which teams will be impacted](/data-design/guides/managing-changes-impacting-multiple-stakeholders), helping you avoid unwanted changes and loop in the right reviewers.
- *(Coming soon)*: A Slack notification is sent to the team channel when a branch contains changes affecting them.

If the team is also the **owner** (alpha), and the workspace is on the enterprise plan, the impacted owners are:
- Automatically added as a **required reviewer** on the branch.  
  → The branch can't be merged until all impacted owners have approved.

[Stakeholder items can be assigned to a Stakeholder team](/workspace-management/domains#adding-stakeholder-events) from the stakeholder details and event details.

## Stakeholders in the tracking plan

In the Events table, you’ll see a **Stakeholders** column that shows which teams are stakeholders in each event.  
You can filter the table by stakeholder team and share the filtered view to help each team focus on events relevant to them.

![Avo events page with stakeholder filters applied](/images/domains/events-domain-filter.png)

In each event’s detail view, you’ll see which teams are stakeholders and which one owns the item.  
Clicking a team name opens a preview where it's possible to:
- See stakeholder team members
- Remove ownership if it's a stakeholder owned event
- Remove from stakeholder team
- Navigate to the team details page.

### Stakeholders in the branched workflow

When a user creates a branch in Avo, the **Impacted Stakeholders** indicator in the branch header shows how many stakeholder teams are affected by the proposed changes.

From there, you can:
- [Tweak the changes to reduce scope](/data-design/guides/managing-changes-impacting-multiple-stakeholders#minimizing-stakeholder-impact)
- [Add impacted teams as reviewers](/data-design/guides/managing-changes-impacting-multiple-stakeholders#aligning-on-cross-stakeholder-changes)

On the Enterprise plan, impacted **owners** are automatically added as required reviewers.
