# The Avo Tracking Plan

The Avo Tracking Plan is where you define the data for your application. It contains
detailed definitions of your tracking plan that can be used to generate
code from and validate your data against.

The following sections build up your Avo workspace:

- [Tracking Plan Events](/data-design/avo-tracking-plan/events): where all events structures are defined

- [Tracking Plan Properties](/data-design/avo-tracking-plan/properties): where all properties are defined

- [Tracking Plan Metrics](/data-design/avo-tracking-plan/metrics): where all metrics are defined

- [Tracking Plan Publishing](/publishing/publishing/overview): sync your tracking plan with the one in your analytics platform

- [Connection Setup](/data-design/define-sources-and-destinations): configure sources and destinations, including setting up Inspector and Avo Codegen

- [Codegen Setup](/implementation/start-using-avo-codegen): source specific event reference for Avo Codegen, with code snippets that help you implement

- [Inspector](/inspector/start-using-inspector): get a report of the state of your tracking and get alerted when new issues are detected
