## Analytics tools and Avo

The analytics tools that Avo support all have it in common that they are event/action
based analytics tools. These tools are used for different purposes, primarily
product analytics and marketing. With Avo, you define the data once for all your
analytics tools and get code-generated data-validating analytics wrappers that ensure
all your tools are streaming out consistent data.

### Custom Destinations

Sometimes the best way to integrate Avo is through a custom destination. For
example:

- When using custom pipelines
- When sending data to analytics platforms through an API (not using their SDK)
- When using a combination of a programming language and analytics destination not yet directly supported by Avo

Please <Link passHref href="/help/troubleshooting"><a>contact us</a></Link> if you are unsure of what is
the best solution for you or if there are any analytics destinations you'd like to see supported in Avo.

To get started using a custom destination you do the following:

1. Create a Custom Destination in the Connections tab
2. Pull the updated code by doing `avo pull` in the Avo CLI
3. Initialize Avo with a custom destination
4. Fill in the empty methods for sending the data to your analytics destination

For detailed instructions on how to set up a custom destination, please see our <Link passHref href="/implementation/start-custom-destination"><a>custom destination docs</a></Link>.
