### Custom Destinations

Sometimes the best way to integrate Avo is through a custom destination. For
example:

- When using custom pipelines
- When sending data to analytics platforms through an API (not using their SDK)
- When using a combination of a programming language and analytics destination not yet directly supported by Avo

Please [contact us](/help/troubleshooting) if you are unsure of what is
the best solution for you or if there are any analytics destinations you'd like to see supported in Avo.

To get started using a custom destination you do the following:

1. Create a Custom Destination in the Sources tab
2. Pull the updated code by doing `avo pull [--branch my-branch] [SourceName]` in the Avo CLI
3. Initialize Avo with a custom destination
4. Fill in the empty methods for sending the data to your analytics destination

For detailed instructions on how to set up a custom destination, please see our [destinations docs](/implementation/destinations).
