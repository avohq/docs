# Defining object properties

In your Avo Tracking Plan properties can have 5 different types, string, integer, float, boolean and object. Learn more about properties in general [in this doc](/workspace/tracking-plan/properties).

In this guide we'll go through the process of defining an object property, including constraints on its keys and values.

<Callout>
  The object type is currently behind a feature flag. Reach out to us if you
  want to start defining object properties in your tracking plan.

### Step 1: Set the property type to object

Click the type dropdown in the property drawer and select "object"

</center>

### Step 2: Define constraints on which keys and values the object should contain

1. Click the "+ Add rule" button

   <center>
     <img src={'/images/workspace/tracking-plan/property-add-rule.png'} />
   </center>

2. Add the properties you'd like to include in the object
   <Callout>
     All properties in Avo are shared globally throughout the tracking plan,
     this includes the sub-properties of object properties. You can [learn more
     about the global namespace in Avo in this
     doc](/data-design/global-namespace).

   </center>

### Congrats, you've defined your first object property in Avo!
