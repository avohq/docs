Open the <Link passHref href="/workspace/inspector#Overview">Inspector overview</Link>, browse the list or search for specific event, select it and the right panel will appear with detailed information about the health of the given event.

From there you would be able to analyze the problems with the given event, if any, change event description in the tracking plan or add it to the tracking plan if it is not there yet.

When you fix the issue in the client you will be able to see how the problem is gradually resolved as you clients update.
