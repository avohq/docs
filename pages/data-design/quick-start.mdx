# Quickstart: Tracking Plan in Avo

Managing a tracking plan is hard. You have to make sure it's kept up to date to what is actually being tracked, make sure existing events and properties are reused where relevant, make sure new events and properties match with the naming conventions you have in place, communicating changes and collect feedback from the team, share implementation instructions with developers, and so on.

If you relate to any of the challenges mentioned above you might want to consider switching your tracking plan over to Avo.

The Avo Tracking Plan is a collaborative web app that will make managing your tracking plan less of a headache, with features like [Tracking Plan audit](/audit/overview) to ensure naming conventions are followed, [global event and property namespace](/data-design/global-namespace) to ensure consistency across your events and properties, [branched collaboration](/data-design/branches) with [approval workflows](/data-design/branches/approval-workflows) and [auto generated implementation instructions](/data-design/branches#share-the-implementation-instructions), [auto publishing](/publishing/publishing/overview) to keep your downstream schemas in sync, and more!

When you have your tracking plan defined in Avo you can check out our [code generated, type-safe, functions](/implementation/avo-codegen-overview) for developers to increase tracking implementation speed and reliability, and tracking observability with the [Inspector](/data-design/start-using-inspector) so you know how your _actual_ tracking compares to the tracking plan.

In this guide we'll walk through the process of setting up your tracking plan in Avo, suggesting your first changes on a branch, inviting a team member and asking for a review. If you're looking for a deeper dive into the tracking plan design capabilities of the Avo Tracking Plan, check out our [deep dive guide on data design in Avo](/data-design/start-data-design).

## Step 1: Create an Avo workspace

Head to our [onboarding flow](https://avo.app/onboarding) and setup a new workspace.

## Step 2: Get your existing tracking plan into Avo

 There are three ways to get your existing tracking plan into Avo:
- [Import from Amplitude, Mixpanel or Google Sheets](/publishing/importing)
- [Import events from Inspector](/inspector/add-events-from-inspector)
- [Build your tracking plan from scratch](/data-design/start-data-design)

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  If you don't have an existing tracking plan, or if you just want to start
  fresh, you can skip this step. No worries, you can always import your existing
  tracking plan later.

## Step 3: Create a new branch

When you are making changes to your tracking plan in Avo, we always recommend creating a [branch](/docs/data-design/branches) first â€“ no matter how small your change might be. That allows you to make suggestions in isolation from the source of truth on your main branch and get feedback from your team.

Open a new branch by clicking the icon next to "main" in the left sidebar. Then you are prompted to open an existing branch or creating a new one.

    }
    alt="Opening a branch"
    width="100%"
  />
</center>
<br />

## Step 4: Make changes to your tracking plan

When you've created the branch, navigate to the _Events_ tab in the tracking plan to start making changes to your tracking plan on the branch. Create a new [event](/docs/data-design/avo-tracking-plan/events) by clicking the _+ Add Event_ button.

    }
    alt="Creating an event"
    width="100%"
  />
</center>
<br />

In the event details, complete the definition of your event by filling in each section of the event details. Check out our [data design deep dive guide](/data-design/start-data-design) for a step by step guide for defining an event. Below is an example of an event with a [description](/docs/data-design/best-practices/defining-descriptive-events-and-properties#events-1), [triggers](/docs/data-design/guides/event-triggers), [sources](/docs/data-design/define-sources-and-destinations) and a [property](/docs/data-design/avo-tracking-plan/properties).

<br />
<center>
  <video
    loop
    muted
    autoPlay
    controls
    src={
      '/docs/images/data-design/quickstart/review-event-definition.mp4'
    }
    alt="Event details"
    width="100%"
  />
</center>
<br />

New and modified events are highlighted in the [workbench](/docs/data-design/avo-tracking-plan/workbench) at the top of your tracking plan events view, so you can easily access and have overview of your new and modified events.

## Step 5: Invite a colleague and ask them for a review

Now we're ready to share our suggestions with our team, and ask them for input. Go to your workspace settings and invite a team member. Workspace members can be one of admin, editor, comment only or view only. To learn more about members and roles, check out our [members docs](/data-design/collaboration/members).

<br />
<center>
  <video
    loop

    autoPlay
    controls
    width="100%"
    src={'/docs/images/data-design/quickstart/invite-member.mp4'}
    alt="Reviewing a branch and adding a collaborator"
  />
</center>

When your colleague has joined the workspace they have access to the tracking plan, can create their own branches (editors and admins) and you can request their feedback  (comment only, editors and admins) by adding them as a collaborator on your branch.

To review the changes on your branch, click the _View changes_ button in the workspace sidebar. There are two review modes, one for tracking plan changes and another for [code changes](/docs/data-design/branches/code-changes). 

### Tracking plan changes
The tracking plan changes represent the changes that are made to the data structures in your tracking plan. There you and collaborators can comment on each item and discuss them. To add a collaborator to your branch, click _Edit Collaborators_ in the top right corner of the view changes screen and select the workspace member you want to add. Branch collaborators will be notified on any discussions on the branch and when the branch status changes.

    alt="Reviewing a tracking plan changes on a branch and adding a collaborator"
  />
</center>

### Code changes
The [code changes screen](/docs/data-design/branches/code-changes) represents the code changes that are required to implement the tracking plan changes in code. Code snippets are available for all events, whether they are to be implemented with manual implementation or the [Avo codegen]. A collaborator can review the code changes, comment on them and then approve the branch or request changes. Learn more about branch approvals in our [approval workflow guide](/docs/data-design/branches/approval-workflows).

## What's next?

Now you know how to open a branch in Avo, suggest changes and ask for review from your team. The next step is for a developer to implement the changes in code using [Avo codegen](/docs/implementation/avo-codegen-overview) or [pseudocode snippets](/docs/data-design/branches/code-changes#non-codegen-snippets). To get even better idea of how to maintain your tracking plan in Avo, check out the [deep dive guide on data design in Avo](/data-design/start-data-design).
