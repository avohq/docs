title: 'Organizing Multi-Product Workspaces'
---

For companies that have multiple products or multiple games, we recommend using a single workspace in Avo for the tracking plans for all of them. Having a single workspace enables companies to reuse events and properties across products/games and that way prevent discrepancies between them. 

To organize the events and properties; sources, categories, tags and property groups can be used. All of those ways to organize can also be used to filter, to create a relevant view for each use case.

**Sources** represent each codebase, whether the code base is shared across products or individual for each product x platform. You can use sources to configure whether properties are always, sometimes or never sent with an event and configure string constraints that are applicable for each product. So you'll have a source for each product and each platform like:
- Product A – iOS
- Product A – Android
- Product A – Web
- Product B – iOS
- Product B – Android
- Product B – Web
- etc…

**Categories** could be used to make collections of events such as:
- Core events – a category of events that are applicable for all products/games
- Genre specific events – a category per group of events that are applicable for specific genres or subject matter (in a game example there could be "Battle events", "Puzzle events" etc.)
- Product/Game specific events – events that are specific for each individual product or game

**Tags** could be used for anything else that you would like to organize your events by. Examples of how tags have been used:
– Countries that the events are applicable for
– Team ownership of the events
– User journeys

**Property groups** can be used in a similar way as the categories, grouping properties together that are commonly used together on events

Below is an example of a tracking plan for a game company that has 3 games; Game A, Game B and Game C:

And below is an example of the tracking plan being filtered on events for Game A and Discovery team only:

  alt="Multi-product tracking plan filtered"
  width="100%"
/>

*Example tracking plan for a game company with three games in one Avo Workspace filtered to view only events sent from Game A and tagged for the Discovery team.*
