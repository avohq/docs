# Getting started to collaborate in Avo

## Commenting

All the individual items in your Avo Tracking plan can be commented on.

You can comment on events, properties, metrics, integration and many more!

_Look for comment input fields like this one_

Note that your comments live on the branch you are on when making the comment. Then, when the branch is merged, they become available on the main branch. That means all discussions will always be available for future reference.

### Commenting during branch review

When reviewing a branch comments are brought to the highlight on the `Review` screen.

### Collaborating in comments

Avo has a concept called collaborators. All collaborators of the item on which the comment is made will get notifications about that comment.

You can add someone as collaborator to any item by @-mentioning that person.

You can also use `Edit Collaborators` button to add or remove collaborators.

Notice that when you @-mention someone they will automatically appear in the collaborators list.
