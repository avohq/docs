Inspired by the amazing team at <Link href="https://basecamp.com/yes"><a>Basecamp</a></Link>, we’d like to offer you our guide to all the ways Avo can work for you. 

### Can I use Avo to diagnose analytics issues?
Yes, you can! The Inspector SDK will automatically <Link passHref href="/inspector/issue-identifier"><a>monitor the health of your current tracking</a></Link> and suggest fixes for issues such as missing events or properties, casing inconsistencies, property type mismatches, significant difference in volumes between platforms and many more.

### Can I use Avo without adjusting my Privacy Policy?
Yes, you can! Avo does not collect any user data. We only collect metadata about your user data. Avo doesn’t need to know the actual values, we only need to understand the shape of the data.

### Can I use Avo to fix analytics issues?
Yes, you can! The Inspector SDK will automatically <Link passHref href="/inspector/issue-identifier"><a>monitor the health of your current tracking</a></Link> and suggest fixes for issues such as missing events or properties, casing inconsistencies, property type mismatches, significant difference in volumes between platforms and many more.

### Can I use Avo to generate analytics tracking code?
Yes, you can! We offer a few different ways to do this. You can pull the <Link passHref href="/commands#step-3-pull-generated-analytics-wrappers-from-avo"><a>analytics wrappers from the CLI</a></Link>, or you can copy them from <Link passHref href="/workspace/implement#a-nameimplement-actionsa-implement-events"><a>within the Avo UI</a></Link>.

### Can I use the Inspector on my dev environment? What about production?
Yes, you can! You can utilize Inspector in any environment. However, we suggest using Production data to surface issues accurately.

### Can I use Avo in production without crashing my app?
Yes, you can! <Link passHref href="/data-validation"><a>Validation logs and warnings</a></Link> are by default only sent in the development environment, not in production. Strict mode validation can be enabled in development, which throws errors instead of logging them.

### Can I sort and organize my events and analytics in Avo?
Yes, you can! We recommend setting up and <Link passHref href="/best-practices/organizing-metrics-and-events"><a>utilizing Categories</a></Link> and tags to keep track of events from different product features.

### Can I use Avo to draft changes to my tracking plan in isolation?
Yes, you can! We have a branched workflow and encourage all users to never directly edit the master branch. Avo’s Branched Workflow lets multiple teams work on conflicting metrics changes without disrupting each other’s work.

### Can I use Avo to collaborate with my teammates?
