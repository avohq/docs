# Import a CSV of Your Existing Tracking Plan

_Import your tracking plan from various sources to get started quickly_

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  **Import existing tracking specs into Avo to get started quickly**. We know
  that tracking plans come in all shapes and sizes. If you don't see your format
  below you can try converting your existing spreadsheet to one of our supported
  formats or [reach out](/help/troubleshooting#contact-us) and we'll support
  you.
</Callout>

## What To Import

You can import your [event schemas](#import-tracking-plan), [user properties](#import-user-properties), [group properties](#import-group-properties), and [name mapping](#import-name-mapping).

### Import Tracking Plan

Import your existing event schemas, aka tracking plan, to get started
quickly.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  When importing events that already exist in Avo, the importer will only import
  new properties, categories and tags for the event. The importer will never
  archive or delete existing events or properties, or remove properties,
  categories or tags from existing events. You can also import user properties,
  group properties, and name mapping.
</Callout>

See [supported formats for importing event schemas, aka tracking plans](/publishing/import/importing#supported-formats).

### Import User Properties

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  **User properties** are helpful to segment behaviors by current state of
  users, as opposed to the state at the time of an event trigger. Read about
  [user property use cases and how they
  work](/data-design/avo-tracking-plan/properties#user-properties).
</Callout>

See [supported formats for importing user properties](/publishing/importing#user-property-import-format).

### Import Group Properties

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  **Group analytics** are important for b2b companies and can be useful in many
  other cases. Read about [group analytics use cases and how it
  works](/data-design/best-practices/groups).
</Callout>

See [supported formats for importing group properties](/publishing/importing#group-property-import-format).

### Import Name Mapping

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  **Different names to different destinations:** You might need to send events
  and properties with different names to different destinations if: **_a/ You
  have legacy event structures in specific analytics tools_**, which you can't
  change now because you need to data continuity in these tools. **_b/ Analytics
  destinations require specific event or property names_** for some
  functionality. Read more about [name mapping](/data-design/name-mapping) and
  its [use cases](/data-design/name-mapping#use-cases-for-name-mapping).
</Callout>

You can import destination specific name mapping for new events and properties using the [Avo's ultimate tracking plan CSV from](/publishing/importing#avos-ultimate-tracking-plan-template).

### Group Property Import Format

CSV format for importing.

**Note:**

- The order of the columns in your sheet does not matter
- There must be a header row in your sheet with the exact column names as described for one of the format below
- Any additional columns are ignored

## Import Methods

You can select from two import methods when importing your tracking plan:

- **Add only**: This is the default import method. The importer will only append new items from the imported file to your tracking plan. No destructive changes will be made to existing items in your tracking plan.
- **Add and update**: This import method will append new items from the imported file to your tracking plan and update existing items with the same name to match the imported file. Note that this import will not remove any items from your tracking plan.

  The **Add and Update** import method is currently in a close beta. Please
  reach out to us if you'd like to try it out.

## Troubleshooting

### How do I prevent importing duplicates of my properties?

The importer attempts to merge properties from imported events using the following criteria:

- The property name matches
- The property type matches
- The description matches

If these three criteria are not fulfilled, the importer doesn't merge the properties. The reason we
decided to include the description in this criteria is that a property that shares a name and a type,
can still have a totally different meaning based on the description, and documenting that
difference clearly in the tracking plan is critical to ensure everyone share the same understanding
of what the property should contain in different context.

In the case where you have aligned your names and types, but the description is different, you can:

- **If the properties should be merged and you are in a position to reset your tracking plan**: Unify the description in your import file, [reset the tracking plan](/data-design/guides/reset-tracking-plan)
  , and re-run the import. This will result in the properties being merged on import.
- **If the properties should be merged**: Use the ["Replace property with..." feature](/data-design/avo-tracking-plan/properties#replacing-a-property) in the context menu of the property modal
- **If the properties should not be merged**: Provide unique name and descriptions to better differentiate between these properties in the tracking plan
