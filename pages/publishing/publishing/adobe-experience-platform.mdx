# Adobe Experience Platform

*Publishing your tracking plan to the Adobe Experience Platform*

![Adobe Logo](/images/publishing_adobe.svg)

## Introduction

The integration to [Adobe Experience Platform XDM system](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/xdm/home) allows you to publish your [Avo Tracking Plan](/publishing/publishing/overview) to Adobe Experience Platform in form of XDM field groups. You can set up the integration to automatically publish on every Avo branch merge or manually trigger a publish. 

## Configuring the Adobe Experience Platform integration

To enable the direct integration with AEP, navigate to the Publishing Screen in your Avo workspace, click “Add Integration” and select “Adobe Experience Platform. See details in our [setting up and configuring a publishing integration docs](/publishing/publishing/overview#setting-up-and-configuring-a-publishing-integration)

You will need to provide the following parameters from Adobe:

- **Adobe Client Id**
- **Adobe Organization ID**
- **Adobe Client Secret**

 These parameters can be found from the Adobe Developer Console -> Projects -> Workspaces -> Credentials. The URL should look like this: `https://developer.adobe.com/console/projects/{customerId}/{projectId}/workspaces/{workspaceId}/credentials/{credentialId}/details/{credentialsName}`.


## Publishing to the Adobe Experience Platform

To publish the field groups based on your Avo tracking plan to the Adobe Experience Platform, navigate to the details of the AEP integration that you just created and click the "Publish" button. Enable Auto Publishing to trigger an automatic publish whenever a branch has been merged.

### What Is Included In The Publish to Adobe Experience Platform?

On publish, Avo will fetch all your existing field groups from AEP, compare them with the Avo Property Bundles, included into the publishing integration, and publish new and updated XDM field groups. By default Avo will publish all included property bundles on the branch that you are on as field groups, but you can configure the publish to be [filtered by Sources, Destinations and Tags](/publishing/publishing/overview#filtering-events-for-publishing).

> All entities published by Avo have `/avo/` in their ids, for example `https://ns.adobe.com/TENANT_ID/mixins/avo/{property-bundle-id}`


#### Property Bundles map to XDM Field Groups

Avo Property Bundles map directly to XDM Field Groups. Property Bundles represent global sets of properties that can be reused across multiple events within Avo, mirroring the reuse of Field Groups across XDM schemas. This makes Property Bundles ideal for simultaneously managing your Avo Tracking Plan and corresponding XDM Schemas in Adobe Experience Platform.

Experience Events:

- **title**: Title of the Property Bundle becomes the Field Group's title
- **definitions/property/properties/TENANT_ID/properties**: contains list of XDM properties created from the Avo properties, included into the Property Bundle, where `type` is the property type defined in Avo, `title` is the property name or name mapping defined in Avo and `description` is the property description provided in Avo
- **meta:intendedToExtend**: set to `https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/experienceevent`

#### Handling changes

**Non breaking changes** are handled with a seamless field group update. When a non-breaking change is synced, your existing schema will be updated with the new field and can be used without any action from your side.

**Breaking changes** are handled by creating a new field group with a version suffix, e.g. `..._v2`. You will need to update your AEP schema setup to reference the new field group.

Learn more about the [breaking changes in AEP](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/xdm/schema/composition#evolution)

##### Versioning

When creating a new field group caused by breaking changes, Avo will automatically increment the version number. You can find the version number of the field group in:
- **title**: for example `{Original Name}_v2`, `{Original Name}_v3` etc.
- **$id**: for example `https://ns.adobe.com/avosoftwaretpp/mixins/avo/{property-bundle-id}_v2`
