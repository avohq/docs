# Adobe Experience Platform

*Publishing your tracking plan to the Adobe Experience Platform*

![Adobe Logo](/images/publishing_adobe.svg)

## Introduction

The integration to [Adobe Experience Platform XDM system](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/xdm/home) allows you to publish your [Avo Tracking Plan](/publishing/publishing/overview) to Adobe Experience Platform in form of XDM schemas. You can set up the integration to automatically publish on every Avo branch merge or manually trigger a publish. 

## Configuring the Adobe Experience Platform integration

To enable the direct integration with AEP, navigate to the Publishing Screen in your Avo workspace, click “Add Integration” and select “Adobe Experience Platform. See details in our [setting up and configuring a publishing integration docs](/publishing/publishing/overview#setting-up-and-configuring-a-publishing-integration)

You will need to provide the following parameters from Adobe:

- **Adobe Client Id**
- **Adobe Organization ID**
- **Adobe Client Secret**

 These parameters can be found from the Adobe Developer Console -> Projects -> Workspaces -> Credentials. The URL should look like this: `https://developer.adobe.com/console/projects/{customerId}/{projectId}/workspaces/{workspaceId}/credentials/{credentialId}/details/{credentialsName}`.


## Publishing to the Adobe Experience Platform

To publish your Avo tracking plan to the Adobe Experience Platform, navigate to the details of the AEP integration that you just created and click the "Publish" button. Enable Auto Publishing to trigger an automatic publish whenever a branch has been merged.

You can also download an XDM file, which you can import into AEP.

### What Is Included In The Publish to Adobe Experience Platform?

On publish, Avo will fetch all your existing XDM schemas and field groups from AEP, compare them with your Tracking Plan and publish new and updated XDM schemas. By default Avo will publish all events on the branch that you are on, but you can configure the publish to be [filtered by Sources, Destinations and Tags](/publishing/publishing/overview#filtering-events-for-publishing).

> All entities published by Avo have `/avo/` in their ids, for example `https://ns.adobe.com/TENANT_ID/mixins/avo/my_properties`

#### Events map to XDM Schemas

The `Log Event` action on Avo events map to Adobe Experience Event schemas. Below are the components of the AEP schema and how Avo populates it for a `Log Event` action:

- **title**: Every included Avo Event with a `Log Event` action will create a XDM Experience Event schema with the same title as the event name. If [name mapping](/data-design/name-mapping) is applied to the event, the name defined by the name mapping is used here
- **description**: The event description as provided in Avo
- **allOf**: Includes the `https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/experienceevent` and a field group, containing all the properties, attached to the `Log Event` action in Avo. See `Properties map to XDM Field Groups` below

The `Update User Properties` action on Avo events map to Adobe Profile schemas. Below are the components of the AEP schema and how Avo populates it for a `Update User Properties` action:

- **title**: Every included Avo Event with a `Update User Properties` action will create a XDM Profile schema with title `{Avo Event Name} Record`. If [name mapping](/data-design/name-mapping) is applied to the event, the name defined by the name mapping is used here
- **description**: The event description as provided in Avo
- **allOf**: Includes the `https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/profile` and a field group containing all the user properties attached to the `Update User Properties` action in Avo. See `Properties map to XDM Field Groups` below

#### Properties map to XDM Field Groups

Experience Events:

- **title**: All the properties of an included event with a `Log Event` action will create an XDM Field Group with title `{Avo Event Name} Properties`. If [name mapping](/data-design/name-mapping) is applied to the event, the name defined by the name mapping is used here
- **definitions/property/properties/TENANT_ID/properties**: contains list of XDM properties created from the Avo event properties, where `type` is the property type defined in Avo, `title` is the property name or name mapping defined in Avo and `description` is the property description provided in Avo
- **meta:intendedToExtend**: set to `https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/experienceevent`

Profile Records:

- **title**: All the properties of an included event with a `Update User Properties` action will create an XDM Field Group with title `{Avo Event Name} User Properties`. If [name mapping](/data-design/name-mapping) is applied to the event, the name defined by the name mapping is used here
- **definitions/property/properties/TENANT_ID/properties**: contains list of XDM properties created from the Avo event properties, where `type` is the property type defined in Avo, `title` is the property name or name mapping defined in Avo and `description` is the property description provided in Avo
- **meta:intendedToExtend**: set to `https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/profile`

#### Handling changes

**Non breaking changes** are handled with a seamless schema or field group update. When a non-breaking change is synced, your existing schema will be updated with the new field and can be used without any action from your side.

**Breaking changes** are handled by creating a new schema or a field group. You will need to update your AEP setup to reference the new schema or field group.

Learn more about the [breaking changes in AEP](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/xdm/schema/composition#evolution)

##### Versioning

When creating a new schema or field group, Avo will automatically increment the version number. You can find the version number in the schema or field group in:
- **title**: for example `{Original Name}_v2`, `{Original Name}_v3` etc.
- **$id**: for example `https://ns.adobe.com/avosoftwaretpp/mixins/avo/my_properties_v2`
