# Managing Stakeholder Teams

Defining stakeholder teams in Avo is a key step toward more organized, scalable data management, especially in larger workspaces with multiple teams. 
It enables your entire organization to operate within a single namespace, sharing data structures and working towards more consolidated tracking, while ensuring that the entities of your organization can operate comfortably without stepping on each-others’ toes.

By documenting stakeholders and owners on the events in your tracking plan, anyone is able to understand who is relying on which events and who to loop in when changes are made or if an issue comes up.

## Creating a Stakeholder team

To see and manage your stakeholder teams in Avo, navigate to your workspace settings and click to the tab labeled “Stakeholders”.
From there you can navigate to a view each stakeholder team in your workspace

Workspace admins can create new stakeholder teams by clicking on Create Stakeholder.
Give the stakeholder team a name and assign a stakeholder lead.
Click create, and then the stakeholder team has been created.

## Managing stakeholder teams

Once created, the stakeholder lead in addition to workspace admins can start setting up the stakeholder team.
Stakeholder teams are managed in Stakeholder Team details accessible via the Stakeholders tab in workspace settings.

### Stakeholder team settings

During the alpha, all stakeholder teams behave the same, so there are no stakeholder specific settings yet.
Currently, there is one setting available for workspaces on the enterprise plan in the General tab of Workspace Settings.
There you can toggle on "Require reviews from owning stakeholders".

That means that each stakeholder team that owns an event that is impacted by branch changes, will be automatically added as a required reviewer to the branch.
The branch is not considered approved – and can not be merged – until a member with approval privileges from each impacted owner team has approved the branch.

### Adding stakeholder team members

Under the “Team” section, click “Manage” which will open a modal where you can search for members in your workspace and add them to the stakeholder team.

**Event details**

### Setting event ownership

Stakeholder teams can claim ownership of events attached to their team from the stakeholder details and event details.
When there is already an owner, a workspace admin or someone from the owner team needs to first remove ownership, before another team can claim ownership.

**Stakeholder details**

In the stakeholder event list, click "Assign to this team" on the stakeholder event you wish to own.

### Who can create and manage stakeholder teams
Workspace admins alone can create stakeholder teams and assign stakeholder leads. They can also manage any stakeholder team.
Stakeholder leads can assign the "Can approve" privilege to stakeholder team members.
Any stakeholder team member can add members and items to their own stakeholder team.
